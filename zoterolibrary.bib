  abstract = {The profound changes in global SO 2 emissions over the last decades have affected atmospheric composition on a regional and global scale with large impact on air quality, atmospheric deposition and the radiative forcing of sulfate aerosols. Reproduction of historical atmospheric pollution levels based on global aerosol models and emission changes is crucial to prove that such models are able to predict future scenarios. Here, we analyze consistency of trends in observations of sulfur components in air and precipitation from major regional networks and estimates from six different global aerosol models from 1990 until 2015. There are large interregional differences in the sulfur trends consistently captured by the models and observations, especially for North America and Europe. Europe had the largest reductions in sulfur emissions in the first part of the period while the highest reduction came later in North America and East Asia. The uncertainties in both the emissions and the representativity of the observations are larger in Asia. However, emissions from East Asia clearly increased from 2000 to 2005 followed by a decrease, while in India a steady increase over the whole period has been observed and modelled. The agreement between a bottom-up approach, which uses emissions and process-based chemical transport models, with independent observations gives an improved confidence in the understanding of the atmospheric sulfur budget.},

  abstract = {Forests play a key role in the carbon cycle as they store huge quantities of organic carbon, most of which is stored in soils, with a smaller part being held in vegetation. While the carbon storage capacity of forests is influenced by forestry, the long-term impacts of forest managers' decisions on soil organic carbon (SOC) remain unclear. Using a meta-analysis approach, we showed that conventional biomass harvests preserved the SOC of forests, unlike intensive harvests where logging residues were harvested to produce fuelwood. Conventional harvests caused a decrease in carbon storage in the forest floor, but when the whole soil profile was taken into account, we found that this loss in the forest floor was compensated by an accumulation of SOC in deeper soil layers. Conversely, we found that intensive harvests led to SOC losses in all layers of forest soils. We assessed the potential impact of intensive harvests on the carbon budget, focusing on managed European forests. Estimated carbon losses from forest soils suggested that intensive biomass harvests could constitute an important source of carbon transfer from forests to the atmosphere (142-497 Tg-C), partly neutralizing the role of a carbon sink played by forest soils.},

The effectiveness of fuelbreaks remains a subject of debate because of differing fuelbreak objectives, prescriptions for creation and maintenance, and their placement in landscapes with differing fire regimes. A well-designed fuelbreak will alter the behavior of wildland fire entering the fuel-altered zone. Both surface and crown fire behavior may be reduced. Shaded fuelbreaks must be created in the context of the landscape within which they are placed. No absolute standards for fuelbreak width or fuel reduction are possible, although recent proposals for forested fuelbreaks suggest 400 m wide bands where surface fuels are reduced and crown fuels are thinned. Landscape-level treatments such as prescribed fire can use shaded fuelbreaks as anchor points, and extend the zone of altered fire behavior to larger proportions of the landscape. Coupling fuelbreaks with area-wide fuel treatments can reduce the size, intensity, and effects of wildland fires. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We found robust patterns in terms of an extra-tropical loss of carbon, except for a temperature induced shift in phenology, leading to an increased spring uptake of carbon. There are less robust patterns in the tropics, a result of disagreement in projections of precipitation and temperature. Although the simulations generally agree well in terms of the sign of the carbon balance change in the middle to high latitudes, there are large differences in the magnitude of the loss between simulations. Together with tropical uncertainties these discrepancies accumulate over time, resulting in large differences in total carbon uptake over the coming century (0.97-2.27 Pg C yr1 during 2006-2100). The terrestrial biosphere becomes a net source of carbon in ten of the 18 simulations adding to the atmospheric CO2 concentrations, while the remaining eight simulations indicate an increased sink of carbon. {\copyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Global vegetation models and terrestrial carbon cycle models are widely used for projecting the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems. Ensembles of such models show a large spread in carbon balance predictions, ranging from a large uptake to a release of carbon by the terrestrial biosphere, constituting a large uncertainty in the associated feedback to atmospheric CO2 concentrations under global climate change. Errors and biases that may contribute to such uncertainty include ecosystem model structure, parameters and forcing by climate output from general circulation models (GCMs) or the atmospheric components of Earth system models (ESMs), e.g. as prepared for use in IPCC climate change assessments. The relative importance of these contributing factors to the overall uncertainty in carbon cycle projections is not well characterised. Here we investigate the role of climate model-derived biases by forcing a single global ecosystem-carbon cycle model, with original climate outputs from 15 ESMs and GCMs from the CMIP5 ensemble. We show that variation among the resulting ensemble of present and future carbon cycle simulations propagates from biases in annual means of temperature, precipitation and incoming shortwave radiation. Future changes in carbon pools, and thus land carbon sink trends, are also affected by climate biases, although to a smaller extent than the absolute size of carbon pools. Our results suggest that climate biases could be responsible for a considerable fraction of the large uncertainties in ESM simulations of land carbon fluxes and pools, amounting to about 40\% of the range reported for ESMs. We conclude that climate bias-induced uncertainties must be decreased to make accurate coupled atmosphere-carbon cycle projections.},

Increasing the albedo of urban and human settlement areas can in turn decrease atmospheric temperature and could potentially offset some of the anticipated temperature increase caused by global warming. We have simulated the long-term (decadal to centennial) effect of increasing urban surface albedos using a spatially explicit global climate model of intermediate complexity. We first carried out two sets of simulations in which we increased the albedo of all land areas between {\textpm}20{$^\circ$} and {\textpm}45{$^\circ$} latitude respectively. The results of these simulations indicate a long-term global cooling effect of 3 {\texttimes}10-15 K for each 1 m2 of a surface with an albedo increase of 0.01. This temperature reduction corresponds to an equivalent CO2 emission reduction of about 7 kg, based on recent estimates of the amount of global warming per unit CO2 emission. In a series of additional simulations, we increased the albedo of urban locations only, on the basis of two independent estimates of the spatial extent of urban areas. In these simulations, global cooling ranged from 0.01 to 0.07 K, which corresponds to a CO2 equivalent emission reduction of 25-150 billion tonnes of CO2. {\copyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The parameterization was based on measurements of over 950 trees sampled from two forest sites. The sampled trees were felled and separated into three biomass compartments (stem, coarse branches, and fine brushwood) and weighed on site. The dry weight of sub samples from each compartment was measured. Equations were derived for total aboveground biomass, stem biomass, and crown biomass using regression analyses. We either used diameter at breast height as single independent explanatory variable or in combination with tree height. Biomass production of stump sprouts and generatively grown stems was compared for ash and sycamore maple. In the same age classes, it was found that ash stump sprouts had a slightly higher production than seed-grown stems. For sycamore maple, no difference was detected. {\copyright} 2014 {\copyright} 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

We synthesized the modelling literature on forest resilience, summarizing common models and applications in resilience research, and scrutinizing the implementation of important resilience mechanisms in these models. Models applied to assess resilience are highly diverse, and our goal was to assess how well they account for important resilience mechanisms identified in experimental and empirical research. Location: Global. Time period: 1994 to 2019. Major taxa studied: Trees. Methods: We reviewed the forest resilience literature using online databases, selecting 119 simulation modelling studies for further analysis. We identified a set of resilience mechanisms from the general resilience literature and analysed models for their representation of these mechanisms. Analyses were grouped by investigated drivers (resilience to what) and responses (resilience of what), as well as by the type of model being used. Results: Models used to study forest resilience varied widely, from analytical approaches to complex landscape simulators. The most commonly addressed questions were associated with resilience of forest cover to fire. Important resilience mechanisms pertaining to regeneration, soil processes, and disturbance legacies were explicitly simulated in only 34 to 46\% of the model applications. Main conclusions: We found a large gap between processes identified as underpinning forest resilience in the theoretical and empirical literature, and those represented in models used to assess forest resilience. Contemporary forest models developed for other goals may be poorly suited for studying forest resilience during an era of accelerating change. Our results highlight the need for a new wave of model development to enhance understanding of and management for resilient forests.},

  abstract = {Land use contributes to environmental change, but is also influenced by such changes. Climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels' changes alter agricultural crop productivity, plant water requirements and irrigation water availability. The global food system needs to respond and adapt to these changes, for example, by altering agricultural practices, including the crop types or intensity of management, or shifting cultivated areas within and between countries. As impacts and associated adaptation responses are spatially specific, understanding the land use adaptation to environmental changes requires crop productivity representations that capture spatial variations. The impact of variation in management practices, including fertiliser and irrigation rates, also needs to be considered. To date, models of global land use have selected agricultural expansion or intensification levels using relatively aggregate spatial representations, typically at a regional level, that are not able to characterise the details of these spatially differentiated responses. Here, we show results from a novel global modelling approach using more detailed biophysically derived yield responses to inputs with greater spatial specificity than previously possible. The approach couples a dynamic global vegetative model (LPJ-GUESS) with a new land use and food system model (PLUMv2), with results benchmarked against historical land use change from 1970. Land use outcomes to 2100 were explored, suggesting that increased intensity of climate forcing reduces the inputs required for food production, due to the fertilisation and enhanced water use efficiency effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but requiring substantial shifts in the global and local patterns of production. The results suggest that adaptation in the global agriculture and food system has substantial capacity to diminish the negative impacts and gain greater benefits from positive outcomes of climate change. Consequently, agricultural expansion and intensification may be lower than found in previous studies where spatial details and processes consideration were more constrained.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance our knowledge about the effects of forest structure on albedo. Here, we present a global assessment of the links between forest structure and albedo at a 1-km spatial resolution using generalized additive models (GAMs). We used remotely sensed data to obtain variables representing forest structure, including forest density, leaf area index, and tree cover, during the peak growing season in 2005 with pure forest pixels that cover {\textasciitilde}7\% of the Earth's surface. Furthermore, we estimated black-sky albedo at a solar zenith angle of 38{$^\circ$} using the most recent collection of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS; version 6) at shortwave, near-infrared, and visible spectral regions. In addition, for the first time, we mapped the magnitude of the relationship between forest structure and albedo at each pixel with a 0.5-degree spatial resolution. Our results suggested that forest structure may modulate albedo in most of the sub-biomes. The response of shortwave albedo was always positive to the leaf area index and negative to the tree cover (except for deciduous broadleaf forests in mediterranean and temperate regions), while the response to forest density varied across space in 2005. The spatial map affirmed that the links between forest structure and albedo vary over geographical locations. In sum, our study emphasized the importance of forest structure in the surface albedo regulation. This paper provides the first spatially explicit evidence of the magnitude of relationships between forest structure and albedo on a global scale.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

  abstract = {{\copyright} 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. Studies examining potential evapotranspiration (PET) for a mature forest reference compared with standard grass are limited in the current literature. Data from three long-term weather stations located within 10 km of each other in the USDA Forest Service Santee Experimental Forest (SEF) in coastal South Carolina were used to (1) evaluate monthly and annual PET estimates from five different methods with varying complexities [Penman-Monteith (P-M), Turc, Thornthwaite (Thorn), Priestley-Taylor (P-T), and Hargreaves-Samani (H-S)] at two grass reference sites; and (2) compare results for the grass sites with PET estimated using the P-M method for a forest reference site using measured daily climatic data for the 2011-2014 period. The grass reference sites are located at the SEF headquarters (SHQ) and in the Turkey Creek watershed (TC). The forest reference station is on a 27-m-tall tower above the canopy of a pine/mixed hardwood forest in watershed WS80 in the SEF. At the WS80 forest site, the highest annual PET (1,351 mm) was observed in 2011 with the lowest rainfall (934 mm), and the lowest PET (1,017 mm) was observed in 2013 with the highest rainfall (1,433 mm), which is consistent with the two grass sites. The temperature-based H-S method yielded estimated monthly and annual PETs that were in better agreement than those of another temperature-based Thorn method at both grass sites when compared against the P-M PET for the forest site. The P-M-based PET values estimated for the SHQ grass site were significantly lower ({$\alpha$}=0.05) than those obtained at the TC grass site and the P-M PET values for the WS80 forest site. The solar radiation-based Turc and temperature-based Thorn PET estimates at both grass sites were significantly different ({$\alpha$}=0.05) from the P-M PET estimates for the forest. These results for the grass sites demonstrate that PET estimates are sensitive to the method used, resulting in significantly different estimates using a single method even for nearby sites because of differences in the complexity of describing the PET process, climatic factors, and interaction with site vegetation types. When compared with the P-M PET for the forest site, the P-T method was in the closest agreement, with the highest R2 of 0.96 and the least bias of 9.7\% in mean monthly estimates, followed by the temperature-based H-S with an R2 of 0.95 and a bias of 12.6\% at the SHQ grass site. It is concluded that the simpler P-T and H-S methods appear to be adequate to estimate forest P-M PET and that their estimates are within the error bounds of the data-intensive P-M PET method for coastal forests.},

Forests with hotter and drier baseline conditions may be protected by prior adaptation, or more vulnerable because they operate closer to physiological limits. Here we report that forests in drier South American climates experienced the greatest impacts of the 2015--2016 El Ni{\~n}o, indicating greater vulnerability to extreme temperatures and drought. The long-term, ground-measured tree-by-tree responses of 123 forest plots across tropical South America show that the biomass carbon sink ceased during the event with carbon balance becoming indistinguishable from zero (-0.02 {\textpm} 0.37 Mg C ha -1 per year). However, intact tropical South American forests overall were no more sensitive to the extreme 2015--2016 El Ni{\~n}o than to previous less intense events, remaining a key defence against climate change as long as they are protected.},

These models will be used in the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) for climate projections, and such evaluation allows identification of the strengths and weaknesses of individual coupled carbon--climate models as well as identification of systematic biases of the models. Results show that models correctly reproduce the main climatic variables controlling the spatial and temporal characteristics of the carbon cycle. The seasonal evolution of the variables under examination is well captured. However, weaknesses appear when reproducing specific fields: in particular, considering the land carbon cycle, a general overestimation of photosynthesis and leaf area index is found for most of the models, while the ocean evaluation shows that quite a few models underestimate the primary production.The authors also propose climate and carbon cycle performance metrics in order to assess whether there is a set of consistently better models for reproducing the carbon cycle. Averaged seasonal cycles and probability density functions (PDFs) calculated from model simulations are compared with the corresponding seasonal cycles and PDFs from different observed datasets. Although the metrics used in this study allow identification of some models as better or worse than the average, the ranking of this study is partially subjective because of the choice of the variables under examination and also can be sensitive to the choice of reference data. In addition, it was found that the model performances show significant regional variations.},

In this review, we draw on the medical literature concerning human death to propose a water resource-based approach to tree mortality that considers the tree as a complex organism with a distinct growth strategy. This approach provides insight into mortality mechanisms at the tree and landscape scales and presents promising avenues into modeling tree death from drought and temperature stress. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Understanding the pathways through which drought stress kills woody vegetation can improve projections of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and carbon-cycle feedbacks. Continuous in situ measurements of whole trees during drought and as trees die hold promise to illuminate physiological pathways but are relatively rare. We monitored leaf characteristics, water use efficiency, water potentials, branch hydraulic conductivity, soil moisture, meteorological variables, and sap flux on mature healthy and sudden aspen decline-affected (SAD) trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) ramets over two growing seasons, including a severe summer drought. We calculated daily estimates of whole-ramet hydraulic conductance and modeled whole-ramet assimilation. Healthy ramets experienced rapid declines of whole-ramet conductance during the severe drought, providing an analog for what likely occurred during the previous drought that induced SAD. Even in wetter periods, SAD-affected ramets exhibited fivefold lower whole-ramet hydraulic conductance and sevenfold lower assimilation than counterpart healthy ramets, mediated by changes in leaf area, water use efficiency, and embolism. Extant differences between healthy and SAD ramets reveal that ongoing multi-year forest die-off is primarily driven by loss of whole-ramet hydraulic capability, which in turn limits assimilation capacity. Branch-level measurements largely captured whole-plant hydraulic limitations during drought and mortality, but whole-plant measurements revealed a potential role of other losses in the hydraulic continuum. Our results highlight the importance of a whole-tree perspective in assessing physiological pathways to tree mortality and indicate that the effects of mortality on these forests' assimilation and productivity are larger than expected based on canopy leaf area differences. {\copyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Earth's forests harbor extensive biodiversity and are currently a major carbon sink. Forest conservation and restoration can help mitigate climate change; however, climate change could fundamentally imperil forests in many regions and undermine their ability to provide such mitigation. The extent of climate risks facing forests has not been synthesized globally nor have different approaches to quantifying forest climate risks been systematically compared. We combine outputs from multiple mechanistic and empirical approaches to modeling carbon, biodiversity, and disturbance risks to conduct a synthetic climate risk analysis for Earth's forests in the 21st century. Despite large uncertainty in most regions we find that some forests are consistently at higher risk, including southern boreal forests and those in western North America and parts of the Amazon. Climate change is having negative effects on forests through extreme heat, drought, and disturbances. Predicting the impact of future climate change on forests is challenging because each approach relies on assumptions and incomplete data. Anderegg et al . compared results from three major modeling approaches that provide information on different facets of risk: a global mechanistic vegetation model, which estimates forest carbon loss; a climate envelope model, which provides information on species shifts; and empirical assessment of forest loss to disturbance using satellite imagery. These approaches provide complementary information but highlight the high overall risk to forests in the southern boreal, dry tropics, and central Europe. ---BEL Climate change is predicted to change forest composition, decrease carbon, and increase disturbance, with some forests at high risk of all three.},

However, forestry also influences land-surface properties, including albedo (the fraction of incident sunlight reflected back to space), surface roughness, and evapotranspiration, all of which affect the amount and forms of energy transfer to the atmosphere. In some circumstances, these biophysical feedbacks can result in local climate warming, thereby counteracting the effects of carbon sequestration on global mean temperature and reducing or eliminating the net value of climate-change mitigation projects. Here, we review published and emerging research that suggests ways in which forestry projects can counteract the consequences associated with biophysical interactions, and highlight knowledge gaps in managing forests for climate protection. We also outline several ways in which biophysical effects can be incorporated into frameworks that use the maintenance of forests as a climate protection strategy. {\copyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {The increasing interest in bio-based construction materials has resulted in the emergence of the concept of ``buildings as a carbon sink''. Quantifying and comparing the effects of carbon sequestration and storage in buildings from a life cycle perspective involves the evaluation of flows and processes taking place at different timescales and across ecological, technological, and economic domains. This scoping review sheds light on the heterogeneous body of approaches and results from relevant scientific literature of the past decade: 180 articles were reviewed following a systematic search and relevance-checking process. Contributions are evaluated based on the scale of interest (material, building, building stock), the sequestration mechanism (photosynthesis, carbonation) and the accounting methodology adopted to quantify global warming. The majority of works taking a life cycle perspective adopt static methods, with only a few accounting for dynamic effects over time, although more recent studies do tend to recognise the need for dynamic life cycle assessment. A characterisation of current and future carbon storage in the global building stock is still needed, and substantial work remains to be done to validate the theory of buildings as a carbon sink to mitigate the effects of climate change. Reports on carbon stored in durable construction products and buildings mostly find cumulative effects that are less than emissions from fossil fuel use in a single year (ranging from negligible to 175\%). Furthermore, net gains in storage in the built environment can be offset by net losses in forest carbon, and the benefits of substitution with wood are sometimes overstated. Further adoption of bio-based construction materials can -- at best -- only make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation in the context of rapid global progress in decarbonisation.},

The overall magnitude of this sink is constrained by the difference between emissions, the rate of increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, and the ocean sink. However, the land sink is actually composed of two largely counteracting fluxes that are poorly quantified: fluxes from land-use change and CO 2 uptake by terrestrial ecosystems. Dynamic global vegetation model simulations suggest that CO 2 emissions from land-use change have been substantially underestimated because processes such as tree harvesting and land clearing from shifting cultivation have not been considered. As the overall terrestrial sink is constrained, a larger net flux as a result of land-use change implies that terrestrial uptake of CO 2 is also larger, and that terrestrial ecosystems might have greater potential to sequester carbon in the future. Consequently, reforestation projects and efforts to avoid further deforestation could represent important mitigation pathways, with co-benefits for biodiversity. It is unclear whether a larger land carbon sink can be reconciled with our current understanding of terrestrial carbon cycling. Our possible underestimation of the historical residual terrestrial carbon sink adds further uncertainty to our capacity to predict the future of terrestrial carbon uptake and losses.},

  abstract = {The spatial extent of marine and terrestrial protected areas (PAs) was among the most intensely debated issues prior to the decision about the post-\-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Positive impacts of PAs on habitats, species diversity and abundance are well documented. Yet, biodiversity loss continues unabated despite efforts to protect 17\% of land and 10\% of the oceans by 2020. This casts doubt on whether extending PAs to 30\%, the agreed target in the Kunming-\-Montreal GBF, will indeed achieve meaningful biodiversity benefits. Critically, the focus on area coverage obscures the importance of PA effectiveness and overlooks concerns about the impact of PAs on other sustainability objectives. We propose a simple means of assessing and visualising the complex relationships between PA area coverage and effectiveness and their effects on biodiversity conservation, nature-\-based climate mitigation and food production. Our analysis illustrates how achieving a 30\% PA global target could be beneficial for biodiversity and climate. It also highlights important caveats: (i) achieving lofty area coverage objectives alone will be of little benefit without concomitant improvements in effectiveness, (ii) trade-\- offs with food production particularly for high levels of coverage and effectiveness are likely and (iii) important differences in terrestrial and marine systems need to be recognized when setting and implementing PA targets. The CBD's call for a significant increase in PA will need to be accompanied by clear PA effectiveness goals to reduce and revert dangerous anthropogenic impacts on socio-\-ecological systems and biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Afforestation, the conversion of croplands or marginal lands into forests, results in the sequestration of carbon. As a result, afforestation is considered one of the key climate-change mitigation strategies available to governments by the United Nations1. However, forests are also less reflective than croplands, and the absorption of incoming solar radiation is greater over afforested areas. Afforestation can therefore result in net climate warming, particularly at high latitudes2-5. Here, we use a comprehensive Earth system model to assess the climate-change mitigation potential of five afforestation scenarios, with afforestation carried out gradually over a 50-year period. Complete (100\%) and partial (50\%) afforestation of the area occupied at present by crops leads to a reduced warming of around 0.45 and 0.25 {$^\circ$}C respectively, during the period 2081-2100. Temperature benefits associated with more realistic global afforestation efforts, where less than 50\% of cropland is converted, are expected to be even smaller, indicating that afforestation is not a substitute for reduced greenhouse-gas emissions. We also show that warming reductions per unit afforested area are around three times higher in the tropics than in the boreal and northern temperate regions, suggesting that avoided deforestation and continued afforestation in the tropics are effective forest-management strategies from a climate perspective. {\copyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {"Introduction to Optimum Design " is the most widely used textbook in engineering optimization and optimum design courses. It is intended for use in a first course on engineering design and optimization at the undergraduate or graduate level within engineering departments of all disciplines, but primarily within mechanical, aerospace and civil engineering. The basic approach of the text is to describe an organized approach to engineering design optimization in a rigorous yet simplified manner, illustrate various concepts and procedures with simple examples, and demonstrate their applicability to engineering design problems. Formulation of a design problem as an optimization problem is emphasized and illustrated throughout the text. Excel and MATLAB are featured throughout as learning and teaching aids. The 3rd edition has been reorganized and enhanced with new material, making the book even more appealing to instructors regardless of the level they teach the course. Examples include moving the introductory chapter on Excel and MATLAB closer to the front of the book and adding an early chapter on practical design examples for the more introductory course, and including a final chapter on advanced topics for the purely graduate level course. Basic concepts of optimality conditions and numerical methods are described with simple and practical examples, making the material highly teachable and learnable.Applications of the methods for structural, mechanical, aerospace and industrial engineering problems.Introduction to MATLAB Optimization Toolbox.Optimum design with Excel Solver has been expanded into a full chapter.Practical design examples introduce students to usage of optimization methods early in the book.

  abstract = {There appears to be a paradox in the debate over carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies. On the one hand, CDR is recognised as a crucial technical option to offset residual carbon emissions from fossil fuel use, so that it can help a transition to the net-zero energy system. But on the other hand, a serious concern is raised about CDR as a way to circumvent necessary emissions reduction, hence perpetuating the status quo of fossil fuel use. This apparent paradox of CDR, however, has less to do with technology itself but more with the difficulty to move away from carbon lock-in---the deeply entrenched fossil-fuel-based energy system. The challenge of decarbonisation is indeed about eroding the deep lock-ins that perpetuate the production and consumption of fossil fuels. To understand the role of CDR in overcoming carbon lock-in, looking back the past debate on carbon capture and storage (CCS) is instructive. Although both CCS and CDR are criticised for keeping the fossil status quo, there is a crucial difference between them. Unlike CCS, CDR can possibly avoid the risk of reinforced lock-in, given its physical decoupling from fossil fuel use. And yet CDR has the risk of undue substitution that continues unjustly fossil carbon emissions. A change of the framing question is thus needed to puzzle out the paradox of CDR. To rightly place CDR in the challenge of rapid decarbonisation, we should ask more how CDR technologies can be used in alignment with a managed decline to fossil fuel production.},

Tapping this potential requires a better understanding of the complex, simultaneous effects of forest management on biodiversity, carbon stocks and productivity. Here, we used data of 135 one-hectare plots from southwestern Germany to disentangle the relative influence of gradients of management intensity, carbon stocks and forest productivity on different components of forest biodiversity (birds, bats, insects, plants) and tree-related microhabitats. We tested whether the composition of taxonomic groups varies gradually or abruptly along these gradients. The richness of taxonomic groups was rather insensitive to management intensity, carbon stocks and forest productivity. Despite the low explanatory power of the main predictor variables, forest management had the greatest relative influence on richness of insects and tree-related microhabitats, while carbon stocks influenced richness of bats, birds, vascular plants and pooled taxa. Species composition changed relatively abruptly along the management intensity gradient, while changes along carbon and productivity gradients were more gradual. We conclude that moderate increases in forest management intensity and carbon stocks, within the range of variation observed in our study system, might be compatible with biodiversity and climate mitigation objectives in managed forests.},

The total input of C from the plant roots to the soil is not known; however, carbon sequestration in the soil, measured using stable isotopic techniques, was unaffected by herbivory. Fagus responded to herbivory by producing larger leaves, with increased photosynthetic capacity and N content, which largely compensated for the loss of biomass; Abies exhibited no such response. We conclude that despite large interspecific differences in the growth response, tree physiological responses to foliar herbivory are capable of directly modifying soil biological processes.},

Reduced CH4 emissions will slow climate change and reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. This review compiled studies to evaluate the best ways to decrease methane emissions. Longer rumination times reduce methane emissions and milk methane. Other studies have not found this. Increasing propionate and reducing acetate and butyrate in the rumen can reduce hydrogen equivalents that would otherwise be transferred to methanogenesis. Diet can reduce methane emissions. Grain lowers rumen pH, increases propionate production, and decreases CH4 yield. Methane generation per unit of energy-corrected milk yield reduces with a higher-energy diet. Bioactive bromoform discovered in the red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis reduces livestock intestinal methane output by inhibiting its production. Essential oils, tannins, saponins, and flavonoids are anti-methanogenic. While it is true that plant extracts can assist in reducing methane emissions, it is crucial to remember to source and produce plants in a sustainable manner. Minimal lipid supplementation can reduce methane output by 20\%, increasing energy density and animal productivity. Selecting low- CH4 cows may lower GHG emissions. These findings can lead to additional research to completely understand the impacts of methanogenesis suppression on rumen fermentation and post-absorptive metabolism, which could improve animal productivity and efficiency.},

We developed a quantitative model to help managers better understand the effect of different management options on eight ES over time.

We integrated production functions for these eight ES with a forest growth-and-yield model to simulate the effects of three management actions over a 45-year period in northern Arizona, USA. We scaled ES values based on their observed maximum and minimum values as a means to compare achievement levels between ES. These scaled ES values were input into a goal-programming model to identify the optimal management regimes given a corresponding set of five different management objectives. The combination of simulation modeling with goal-programming is a novel approach for evaluating ES responses to management and for optimizing ES attainment objectives. To illustrate the value of this novel approach, we designed management objectives to reflect the likely goals a forest manager may choose for each ES in this region. ES goals were distinguished at the forest- and stand-level spatial extents. Results demonstrate the flexibility of the ES optimization model to plan for a variety of situations and preferences. For instance, two ES management goals viewed as conflicting are the protection of Mexican Spotted Owl habitat and the reduction of fire hazard risk. One ES optimization scenario (Scenario 5) produces a plan that reduces area considered as having a high fire hazard from 56\% to 7\% of the study area in 2015 without any reduction in owl habitat quality throughout the time horizon. We recommend that our methodology be applied and developed further by those in both the research and applied fields of ecosystem sciences.},

Therefore, we studied the effects of N on yields of willows and poplars in a field experiment. The effects of N fertilization on nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions from the loamy-sand soil were also measured. Cuttings of willows (Salix viminalis clone Inger) and poplars (Populus maximovizcii {\texttimes} P. nigra clone max 4) were planted on farmland in 2008. The experiment was arranged in a random block design with three levels of N fertilizer (0, 50, and 75 kg N ha-1 y-1). After 2 y, the trees were harvested for the first time. Fertilization did not affect the yields of willows or poplars. However, the application of 75kg N ha-1 y-1 caused an average increase of N leaching in the willow and poplar plots of 25 kg N ha-1 y-1 and 40 kg N ha-1 y-1, respectively. Emissions of N2O were increased by a maximum of only 0.2 kg N ha-1 y-1. Further, the N fertilizer stimulated the growth of the weed biomass in case of the willow plots by 46\% and of the weed N content by 52\% (r = 0.53).

We based our analysis on a decade of weather and energy flux measurements, collected over two contrasting landscapes, an oak savanna and an annual grassland, growing under the same climate conditions. Over the decade, the daily-averaged, potential air temperature above the aerodynamically rougher and optically darker oak savanna was 0.5{$^\circ$}C warmer than that above the aerodynamically smoother and optically brighter annual grassland. However, air temperature differences were seasonal. Smallest differences in potential air temperature occurred towards the end of spring, when much of the soil moisture reservoir was depleted. Largest differences in potential air temperature occurred during the winter rain season when the grass was green and transpiring and when the trees were senescent or deciduous. To understand the effect of land use on the local climate, we examined the concomitant changes in net radiation, sensible and latent heat exchange, the aerodynamic roughness (Ra), the surface resistance to water transfer (Rs), aerodynamic surface temperature and the growth of the planetary boundary layer, with measurements and model computations. Overall, these biophysical variables provide us with mechanistic information to diagnose and predict how changes in air temperature will follow changes in land use or management. In conclusion, land use change is responsible for having a marked impact on the local climate of a region. At the local level, the change in the surface energy balance, towards a darker and rougher surface, will produce an additive increment to climate warming induced by a greater greenhouse gas burden in the atmosphere. {\copyright}2013 D.

  abstract = {Reforesting and managing ecosystems have been proposed as ways to mitigate global warming and offset anthropogenic carbon emissions. The intent of our opinion piece is to provide a perspective on how well plants and ecosystems sequester carbon. The ability of individual plants and ecosystems to mine carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as defined by rates and cumulative amounts, is limited by laws of physics and ecological principles. Consequently, the rates and amount of net carbon uptake are slow and low compared to the rates and amounts of carbon dioxide we release by fossil fuels combustion. Managing ecosystems to sequester carbon can also cause unintended consequences to arise. In this paper, we articulate a series of key take-home points. First, the potential amount of carbon an ecosystem can assimilate on an annual basis scales with absorbed sunlight, which varies with latitude, leaf area index and available water. Second, efforts to improve photosynthesis will come with the cost of more respiration. Third, the rates and amount of net carbon uptake are relatively slow and low, compared to the rates and amounts and rates of carbon dioxide we release by fossil fuels combustion. Fourth, huge amounts of land area for ecosystems will be needed to be an effective carbon sink to mitigate anthropogenic carbon emissions. Fifth, the effectiveness of using this land as a carbon sink will depend on its ability to remain as a permanent carbon sink. Sixth, converting land to forests or wetlands may have unintended costs that warm the local climate, such as changing albedo, increasing surface roughness or releasing other greenhouse gases. We based our analysis on 1,163 site-years of direct eddy covariance measurements of gross and net carbon fluxes from 155 sites across the globe.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the second part of the mapping of topsoil properties based on the Land Use and Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS). The first part described the physical properties (Ballabio et al., 2016) while this second part includes the following chemical properties: pH, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), calcium carbonates (CaCO3), C:N ratio, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). The LUCAS survey collected harmonised data on changes in land cover and the state of land use for the European Union (EU). Among the 270,000 land use and cover observations selected for field visit, approximately 20,000 soil samples were collected in 24 EU Member States in 2009 together with more than 2000 samples from Bulgaria and Romania in 2012. The chemical properties maps for the European Union were produced using Gaussian process regression (GPR) models. GPR was selected for its capacity to assess model uncertainty and the possibility of adding prior knowledge in the form of covariance functions to the model. The derived maps will establish baselines that will help monitor soil quality and provide guidance to agro-environmental research and policy developments in the European Union.},

We must obviously strive to curb growth in resource-intensive demand, but we also need to identify production systems that meet people's needs at least overall cost to nature. The land-sharing/sparing concept provides a quantitative framework for doing this, centred around the principle that generating meaningful insights requires comparing alternatives that are matched in terms of overall production. Applications of this framework to {$>$}2500 individually assessed species of vertebrates, plants and insects across five continents show that most species decline under farming, and that most would fare least badly under a land-sparing approach -- with high-yield production meeting demand in a relatively small, farmed area, freeing-up space for conservation of intact habitats elsewhere in the landscape. However, important questions remain around how to deliver high yields sustainably, and how to ensure high-yield farming does indeed spare natural habitat. The framework is increasingly being applied in other domains too -- including urban planning, recreation, forestry and fisheries -- where it has the potential to shed light on long-running debates about whether nature would prefer us to concentrate our impact or spread it more lightly but widely. The realization that conservation cannot be delivered without simultaneously considering how humanity meets its needs in these and other sectors is of particular significance as policymakers meet to establish global environmental targets through to 2030 and beyond.},

In this work large-eddy simulations are used to demonstrate that the CCE appears more generally in canopy turbulence. It is indeed a generic feature of canopy turbulence: rH of a canopy is found to reduce with increasing unstable stratification, which effectively increases the aerodynamic roughness for the same physical roughness of the canopy. This relation offers a sufficient condition to construct a general description of the CCE. In addition, we review existing parameterizations for rH from the evapotranspiration literature and test to what extent they are able to capture the CCE, thereby exploring the possibility of an improved parameterization.},

As a part of the CliFF ('Climate feedbacks and benefits of semi-arid forests', a collaboration between KIT, Germany, and the Weizmann Institute, Israel) campaign, we studied the boundary layer dynamics and turbulent transport of energy corresponding to this effect in Yatir Forest situated in the Negev Desert in Israel. The forest surrounded by small shrubs presents a distinct feature of surface heterogeneity, allowing us to study the differences between their interactions with the atmosphere above by conducting measurements with two eddy covariance (EC) stations and two Doppler lidars. As expected, the turbulence intensity and vertical fluxes of momentum and sensible heat are found to be higher above the forest compared to the shrubland. Turbulent statistics indicative of nonlocal motions are also found to differ over the forest and shrubland and also display a strong diurnal cycle. The production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) over the forest is strongly mechanical, while buoyancy effects generate most of the TKE over the shrubland. Overall TKE production is much higher above the forest compared to the shrubland. The forest is also found to be more efficient in dissipating TKE. The TKE budget appears to be balanced on average both for the forest and shrubland, although the imbalance of the TKE budget, which includes the role of TKE transport, is found to be quite different in terms of diurnal cycles for the forest and shrubland. The difference in turbulent quantities and the relationships between the components of TKE budget are used to infer the characteristics of the turbulent transport of energy between the desert and the forest.},

However, combined 4R practices have not been assessed for their potential to reduce N2O emissions at the provincial-scale while also considering trade-offs with other N losses such as leaching or ammonia (NH3) volatilization. The objectives of this study were to develop, validate, and apply a Denitrification-Decomposition model framework at 270 distinct soil-climate regions in Ontario to simulate corn yield and N2O emissions across eleven fertilizer management scenarios during 1986--2015. The results show that broadcasting fertilizer at the surface without incorporation had the highest environmental N loss which was primarily caused by NH3 volatilization. When injected at planting or at sidedress, the NH3 loss was reduced considerably. However, because more N was left in the soil, injection and sidedressing induced more losses by nitrate leaching and N2O emissions. Reduction of N rate as proposed by the DNDC model did not affect crop yield but decreased leaching and N2O emissions. Addition of inhibitors promoted a further reduction in N2O emission (11--16\%) although lesser than the reduction in N rate. Overall, our results emphasize that N rate adjustment following improvements in placement, use of inhibitors, and application timings can mitigate N2O emissions by 42--57\% and result in 3--4\% greater yields compared to baseline scenario in Ontario corn production.},

  abstract = {The release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from decomposing coarse woody debris (CWD) may result in large DOC inputs to the forest soil. Here we investigated the influence of tree species on the amounts and quality of DOC from CWD in the early phase of decomposition.Logs from 13 tree species were exposed in winter 2008/2009 on the soil in a temperate Fagus sylvatica L. forest in Germany. Runoff solutions were periodically collected for 17. months from June 2011-November 2012 underneath logs and the net release of DOC was calculated for each log on an annual scale. The quality of DOC was assessed by its contents of soluble phenols, hydrolysable carbohydrates and by spectroscopic properties. Prior to field exposure of CWD, bark and sapwood were analyzed for their initial element content and water extractable DOC.Concentrations of DOC in log runoff were much (3-10 times) higher than in throughfall for all tree species. Average concentrations in runoff were largest under Quercus and Prunus and lowest under Tilia and Fraxinus. Accordingly, the net release of DOC from the logs was largest under Quercus and Prunus amounting to 60 and 56gCm-2 projected log areayr-1, respectively. The DOC net release for the tree species was positively related to the initial phenol content of sapwood, but not to C/N ratios in bark and sapwood. On a monthly to annual scale, the amount of precipitation had only a small influence on the net release of DOC, but the DOC net release was larger in the growing than in the dormant season. The concentrations of hydrolysable carbohydrates in log runoff were largest for Prunus and Quercus and lowest for Fraxinus and Tilia. Average concentrations of total phenols in runoff ranged from about 2 to 7mgL-1 with Quercus, Fraxinus, Betula, Picea and Larix representing the upper range. Spectroscopic properties indicate that the DOC leached from logs is microbially modified and oxidized in comparison to DOC in initial bark and wood extracts.Our results suggest that the DOC release from CWD is tree species specific in terms of quantity and quality and causes huge DOC fluxes to the soil underneath CWD. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Trees killed by natural disturbances have been recognized by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a promising resource for bioenergy at the global scale. In the eastern boreal forest of Canada, there are two major types of natural disturbances that can generate large amounts of biomass for the production of bioenergy: wildfire and spruce budworm outbreak. For example, the mean burned area between 1970 and 2010 was estimated at 2900 km2 per year. Following such disturbances, typically only trees and stands with a merchantable value, i.e., of acceptable quality for traditional forest products (lumber and pulp) are salvaged. However, adding bioenergy to the potential basket of products may both divert trees of marginal quality and profitability away from traditional products and to bioenergy facilities and lengthen the window of opportunity during which salvage operations can occur. This review shows how the dynamics of wood characteristics of trees affected by natural disturbances can be used to predict through time the basket of wood products that can be taken out of a salvaged stand and ensure the best fit between sources of fibre and types of processing facilities. The most important factors influencing fibre quality include degradation caused by fungi and insects. The most suitable time to salvage trees for the production of lumber in stands killed by either spruce budworm or fire is generally limited to 1-2 years after death. For the production of pulp and paper, trees can usually be salvaged for as long as the wood moisture content remains above the fibre saturation point, but usually is not recommended after 3 or 4 years following death. Thus, past this period, salvaged trees may yield better opportunities for the bioenergy sector. Information on wood as bioenergy feedstock (wood chips, wood pellets and liquid biofuel) highlights the importance of wood chemical components in the chemical reactivity of biofuel. This study offers background knowledge and a framework of analysis that highlights the potential of dead wood from natural disturbances for the production of forest and bioenergy products, which can be further adapted to other regions of the world, building on the Canadian experience of adapting practices to natural disturbances.},

It describes, first of all, the conceptual framework of spatial forest planning by identifying spatial and non-spatial forest-planning concepts. The paper focuses on the spatial considerations or problems of spatial configuration of patches including their size (opening size) and distribution, shape, adjacency or green-up delay, connectivity, proximity, and core area that make the conventional forest-management planning "spatial" powered by geographical information systems (GIS). Then, the paper explains various management approaches to conceptualize the spatial forest planning and analytical decision-making techniques, such as simulation, mathematical optimization and meta-heuristic techniques to solve the spatial forest management problem. It also provides information to measure the performance of various meta-heuristic techniques, when solving large-scale spatial problems. Also, some apparent new requirements, important needs for spatial forest planning, and important unresolved problems in spatial forest planning are identified. In conclusion, development of a hybrid-modeling technique, identification of target landscape structure, characterization of various forest values, such as biodiversity, water production, recreation, visual quality, erosion control, and an enthusiasm to implement the approach are identified important future development to spatial forest modeling. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Addressing the spatio-temporal dynamics of forest development under different management scenarios with varying rotation lengths is a challenge in forest management planning. This research aims to forecast forest development and assess the relative consequences of varying rotation lengths on several ecosystem services such as wood production, habitat for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, water provision, soil protection and cultural values. Forest development is simulated with the ETCAP model to examine the long-term effects of various rotation lengths with silvicultural prescriptions on the ecosystem services. B{\"u}r{\"u}cek forest planning unit is used as a case study area with 10,711 ha forests in upper Mediterranean region of Turkey. Shorter rotation lengths are considered one of the main mitigation measures to climate changes in forestry; however, lead to the increased harvest level, net present value, ground water and soil loss, and reductions in the largest stand volume, understory, basal area, carbon storage and the cultural values with less regulated forest structure. The management scenarios with longer rotation lengths, however, have highlighted improvements in the carbon storage, larger standing volume, mean stand age, basal area and cultural values, and reductions in the mean harvest volume, net present value, ground water and soil loss due to larger-even distribution of tree sizes and stand development stages. An aspiration for a higher level of provisioning services for economic motivations may need to be discarded for the sake of enhancing the capacity of forest ecosystems to sequester more carbon and provide better habitat condition for biodiversity conservation with a careful design and selection of rotation lengths. Overall, the choice of optimal rotation length is highly dependent on a desired set of management objectives and target forest structure driven mostly by management interventions with the appropriate type and level of ecosystem services, provided that a thorough understanding of forest dynamics is achieved by considering both risks and uncertainties associated with natural disturbances and socio-economic conditions.},

Therefore, land-use changes in the Amazon affect precipitation patterns but to what extent remains unclear. Recent studies used hydrological and atmospheric models to estimate the contribution of tree transpiration to precipitation but assumed that precipitation decreases proportionally to the transpired portion of atmospheric moisture. Here, we relaxed this assumption by, first, relating observed hourly precipitation levels to atmospheric column water vapor in a relatively flat study area encompassing a large part of the Amazon. We found that the effect of column water vapor on hourly precipitation was strongly nonlinear, showing a steep increase in precipitation above a column water vapor content of around 60 mm. Next, we used published atmospheric trajectories of moisture from tree transpiration across the whole Amazon to estimate the transpiration component in column water vapor in our study area. Finally, we estimated precipitation reductions for column water vapor levels without this transpired moisture, given the nonlinear relationship we found. Although loss of tree transpiration from the Amazon causes a 13\% drop in column water vapor, we found that it could result in a 55\%--70\% decrease in precipitation annually. Consequences of this nonlinearity might be twofold: although the effects of deforestation may be underestimated, it also implies that forest restoration may be more effective for precipitation enhancement than previously assumed.},

The present-day map is derived from an ensemble of four high-resolution, topographically-corrected climatic maps. The future map is derived from an ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario RCP8.5), by superimposing the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution climatic maps. For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications. The new maps exhibit a higher classification accuracy and substantially more detail than previous maps, particularly in regions with sharp spatial or elevation gradients. We anticipate the new maps will be useful for numerous applications, including species and vegetation distribution modeling.

  abstract = {European forests are an important carbon sink; however, the relative contributions to this sink of climate, atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]), nitrogen deposition and forest management are under debate. We attributed the European carbon sink in forests using ORCHIDEE-FM, a process-based vegetation model that differs from earlier versions of ORCHIDEE by its explicit representation of stand growth and idealized forest management. The model was applied on a grid across Europe to simulate changes in the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of forests with and without changes in climate, [CO2] and age structure, the three drivers represented in ORCHIDEE-FM. The model simulates carbon stocks and volume increment that are comparable - root mean square error of 2 m3 ha-1 yr-1 and 1.7 kg C m-2 respectively - with inventory-derived estimates at country level for 20 European countries. Our simulations estimate a mean European forest NEP of 175 {\textpm} 52 g C m-2 yr-1 in the 1990s. The model simulation that is most consistent with inventory records provides an upwards trend of forest NEP of 1 {\textpm} 0.5 g C m-2 yr-2 between 1950 and 2000 across the EU 25. Furthermore, the method used for reconstructing past age structure was found to dominate its contribution to temporal trends in NEP. The potentially large fertilizing effect of nitrogen deposition cannot be told apart, as the model does not explicitly simulate the nitrogen cycle. Among the three drivers that were considered in this study, the fertilizing effect of increasing [CO2] explains about 61\% of the simulated trend, against 26\% to changes in climate and 13\% only to changes in forest age structure. The major role of [CO2] at the continental scale is due to its homogeneous impact on net primary productivity (NPP). At the local scale, however, changes in climate and forest age structure often dominate trends in NEP by affecting NPP and heterotrophic respiration. {\copyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Extensively managed grasslands are recognized globally for their high biodiversity and their social and cultural values. However, their capacity to deliver multiple ecosystem services (ES) as parts of agricultural systems is surprisingly understudied compared to other production systems. We undertook a comprehensive overview of ES provided by natural and semi-natural grasslands, using southern Africa (SA) and northwest Europe as case studies, respectively. We show that these grasslands can supply additional non-agricultural services, such as water supply and flow regulation, carbon storage, erosion control, climate mitigation, pollination, and cultural ES. While demand for ecosystems services seems to balance supply in natural grasslands of SA, the smaller areas of semi-natural grasslands in Europe appear to not meet the demand for many services. We identified three bundles of related ES from grasslands: water ES including fodder production, cultural ES connected to livestock production, and population-based regulating services (e.g., pollination and biological control), which also linked to biodiversity. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation seemed unrelated to the three bundles. The similarities among the bundles in SA and northwestern Europe suggest that there are generalities in ES relations among natural and semi-natural grassland areas. We assessed trade-offs and synergies among services in relation to management practices and found that although some trade-offs are inevitable, appropriate management may create synergies and avoid trade-offs among many services. We argue that ecosystem service and food security research and policy should give higher priority to how grasslands can be managed for fodder and meat production alongside other ES. By integrating grasslands into agricultural production systems and land-use decisions locally and regionally, their potential to contribute to functional landscapes and to food security and sustainable livelihoods can be greatly enhanced.},

  abstract = {The responses of tropical forests to environmental change are critical uncertainties in predicting the future impacts of climate change. The positive phase of the 2015--2016 El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation resulted in unprecedented heat and low precipitation in the tropics with substantial impacts on the global carbon cycle. The role of African tropical forests is uncertain as their responses to short-term drought and temperature anomalies have yet to be determined using on-the-ground measurements. African tropical forests may be particularly sensitive because they exist in relatively dry conditions compared with Amazonian or Asian forests, or they may be more resistant because of an abundance of drought-adapted species. Here, we report responses of structurally intact old-growth lowland tropical forests inventoried within the African Tropical Rainforest Observatory Network (AfriTRON). We use 100 long-term inventory plots from six countries each measured at least twice prior to and once following the 2015--2016 El Ni{\~n}o event. These plots experienced the highest temperatures and driest conditions on record. The record temperature did not significantly reduce carbon gains from tree growth or significantly increase carbon losses from tree mortality, but the record drought did significantly decrease net carbon uptake. Overall, the long-term biomass increase of these forests was reduced due to the El Ni{\~n}o event, but these plots remained a live biomass carbon sink (0.51 {\textpm} 0.40 Mg C ha-1 y-1) despite extreme environmental conditions. Our analyses, while limited to African tropical forests, suggest they may be more resistant to climatic extremes than Amazonian and Asian forests.},

The paper surveys the main results of RO as applied to uncertain linear, conic quadratic and semidefinite programming. For these cases, computationally tractable robust counterparts of uncertain problems are explicitly obtained, or good approximations of these counterparts are proposed, making RO a useful tool for real-world applications. We discuss some of these applications, specifically: antenna design, truss topology design and stability analysis/synthesis in uncertain dynamic systems. We also describe a case study of 90 LPs from the NETLIB collection. The study reveals that the feasibility properties of the usual solutions of real world LPs can be severely affected by small perturbations of the data and that the RO methodology can be successfully used to overcome this phenomenon.},

The changes in agricultural practices affect many different aspects of the farmland habitat, but agricultural industry, policy and much previous research has tended to be concerned with specific sectors or practices (e.g. pesticide use or cereal husbandry). Here, we review the empirical literature to synthesize the research effort that has been directed to investigate specific practices or goals to make general statements regarding the causes and consequences of farmland biodiversity decline. We argue that the loss of ecological heterogeneity at multiple spatial and temporal scales is a universal consequence of multivariate agricultural intensification and, therefore, that future research should develop cross-cutting policy frameworks and management solutions that recreate that heterogeneity as the key to restoring and sustaining biodiversity in temperate agricultural systems.},

  abstract = {Pine litter fall data, mainly needle litter, were available for 64 plots in a transect from the Arctic Circle in Fennoscandia (41 plots) to southern Spain (22 further plots in continental Europe) and one in the American Midwest). Data originated from a total of eight pine species. Regressions were calculated mainly for needle litter fall and to some extent for total litter fall. We obtained a highly significant linear relationship for needle litter fall and latitude (R-adj(2) = 0.285; n = 58; P {$<$} 0.001) when using needle litter fall data from all pine species. Combining sites in the boreal and Atlantic climates gave an R-adj(2) of 0.732 with n = 45 (P {$<$} 0.001). A multiple linear relationship using stand age, latitude and basal area was highly significant and gave an R-adj(2) value of 0.412 (n = 54; P {$<$} 0.001). For the amount of Scots pine needle litter in Fennoscandia, the best simple linear relationships were obtained with site index (H 100) (R-adj(2) = 0.349), latitude (R-adj(2) = 0.331) and basal area (R-adj(2) = 0.324) as predictor variables, whereas the regressions on altitude and stand age were significant only with P {$<$} 0.01. An X-2 function for stand age improved the relationship with age to R-adj(2) = 0.243. Multiple regression relationships for Fennoscandia between needle litter fall and latitude plus basal area and that to latitude plus basal area plus age were highly significant (R-adj(2) = 0.605 and 0.661, respectively, with n = 41). In a stepwise procedure using data from the same sites, combinations of the factors latitude, site index, basal area and stand age could explain as much as 78 \% of the needle litter fall. For total litter fall as measured by the same method as needle litter we related data from 32 sites to that of needle litter fall and obtained highly significant relationships indicating that needle litter fall may be used as an index for total litter fall.

The root system of selected trees from two poplar (Populus spp.) genotypes - Skado and Koster - were excavated for the determination of coarse (Cr, {\texttheta}{$>$}5mm) and medium-sized (Mr, {\texttheta}2-5mm) roots. After two 2-year rotations, the Cr biomass (dry mass, DM) was higher in the P. trichocarpa {\texttimes} P. maximowiczii genotype Skado (187.0gDM m-2) than in the P. deltoides {\texttimes} P. nigra genotype Koster (155.4gDM m-2). Both genotypes showed a relatively shallow, but extensive root system. Allometric equations were fitted between DM of Cr and Mr, and basal area. The root:shoot ratio decreased exponentially with basal area, showing the same trend for single-stem and multi-shoot trees. The soil coring technique was used to determine Fr mass at different dates and at different soil depths. The highest Fr biomass was detected in the upper 15cm of the soil; no genotypic differences in Fr mass were detected at any soil depth. After coppice Fr mortality was significantly increased and weed root biomass significantly reduced. The coppice of the aboveground stems and shoots resulted in a high input of C into the soil and a large amount of C was stored in belowground tree biomass.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic increases in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are predicted to cause a warming of the global climate by modifying radiative forcing. Carbon dioxide concentration increases may make a further contribution to warming by inducing a physiological response of the global vegetation - a reduced stomatal conductance, which suppresses transpiration. Moreover, a CO2-enriched atmosphere and the corresponding change in climate may also alter the density of vegetation cover, thus modifying the physical characteristics of the land surface to provide yet another climate feedback. But such feedbacks from changes in vegetation structure have not yet been incorporated into general circulation model predictions of future climate change. Here we use a general circulation model iteratively coupled to an equilibrium vegetation model to quantify the effects of both physiological and structural vegetation feedbacks on a doubled-CO2 climate. On a global scale, changes in vegetation structure are found to partially offset physiological vegetation-climate feedbacks in the long term, but overall vegetation feedbacks provide significant regional-scale effects.},

But the overall impact of forestation on climate will also depend on other effects associated with the creation of new forests. In particular, the albedo of a forested landscape is generally lower than that of cultivated land, especially when snow is lying3-9, and decreasing albedo exerts a positive radiative forcing on climate. Here I simulate the radiative forcings associated with changes in surface albedo as a result of forestation in temperate and boreal forest areas, and translate these forcings into equivalent changes in local carbon stock for comparison with estimated carbon sequestration potentials10-12. I suggest that in many boreal forest areas, the positive forcing induced by decreases in albedo can offset the negative forcing that is expected from carbon sequestration. Some high-latitude forestation activities may therefore increase climate change, rather than mitigating it as intended.},

  abstract = {Forest loss and degradation are the greatest threats to biodiversity worldwide. Rising global wood demand threatens further damage to remaining native forests. Contrasting solutions across a continuum of options have been proposed, yet which of these offers most promise remains unresolved. Expansion of high-yielding tree plantations could free up forest land for conservation provided this is implemented in tandem with stronger policies for conserving native forests. Because plantations and other intensively managed forests often support far less biodiversity than native forests, a second approach argues for widespread adoption of extensive management, or `ecological forestry', which better simulates natural forest structure and disturbance regimes -- albeit with compromised wood yields and hence a need to harvest over a larger area. A third, hybrid suggestion involves `Triad' zoning where the landscape is divided into three sorts of management (reserve, ecological/extensive management, and intensive plantation). Progress towards resolving which of these approaches holds the most promise has been hampered by the absence of a conceptual framework and of sufficient empirical data formally to identify the most appropriate landscape-scale proportions of reserves, extensive, and intensive management to minimize biodiversity impacts while meeting a given level of demand for wood. In this review, we argue that this central challenge for sustainable forestry is analogous to that facing food-production systems, and that the land sharing--sparing framework devised to establish which approach to farming could meet food demand at least cost to wild species can be readily adapted to assess contrasting forest management regimes. We develop this argument in four ways: (i) we set out the relevance of the sharing--sparing framework for forestry and explore the degree to which concepts from agriculture can translate to a forest management context; (ii) we make design recommendations for empirical research on sustainable forestry to enable application of the sharing--sparing framework; (iii) we present overarching hypotheses which such studies could test; and (iv) we discuss potential pitfalls and opportunities in conceptualizing landscape management through a sharing--sparing lens. The framework we propose will enable forest managers worldwide to assess trade-offs directly between conservation and wood production and to determine the mix of management approaches that best balances these (and other) competing objectives. The results will inform ecologically sustainable forest policy and management, reduce risks of local and global extinctions from forestry, and potentially improve a valuable sector's social license to operate.},

  abstract = {Europe's forests provide vital habitat for biodiversity and essential ecosystem services whose provision must be sustained or enhanced over the coming century. However, the potential to secure or increase forest ecosystem services, while securing the habitat requirements of taxa remains unclear, especially within the context of uncertain climate and socio-economic developments. To tease out the associated trade-offs and synergies, we used 10 case study landscapes within nine countries throughout Europe. Starting with the current status of the forests in the case study landscapes, we simulated forest development 100 years into the future. Simulations were embedded in three combined climate and socio-economic frame scenarios based on global and European policies which varied in their climate change mitigation efficiency. Scenarios were translated into country specific projections of climate variables, and resultant demands for wood products. Forest management regimes were projected to vary in response to these scenarios at local scales. The specific combinations of alternative forest management practices were based on parallel research and input from local forest stakeholders. For each case study, a specific forest growth simulator was used. In general, the climate scenarios applied did not cause fundamentally different ecosystem service outputs at the case study level. Our results revealed almost no reduction in outcomes for biodiversity indicators with an increase in wood production, and in some cases synergistic results occurred when diversity was actively promoted as part of the management concept. Net carbon uptake was not strongly correlated with biodiversity, indicating that biodiversity-friendly forest management doesn't need to curtail carbon sequestration. Notably, we obtained heterogeneous results for the relation between sustainable wood production and net carbon uptake. Most scenarios resulted in a more or less reduced net carbon uptake over the long term, often due to stand age class distribution shifts. Levels of sustainable wood production varied widely during the simulation period, from significant increases (Sweden, Lithuania) to minor changes (Slovakia, Turkey) and slight decreases (Ireland, Netherlands). We place our results within the larger context of European forest policy and the challenges of simulating and contrasting forest biodiversity and the ecosystem services that societies depend on.},

  pages = {71--82},
  abstract = {The efficiency strategy to exploit the potential for energy savings in buildings still is applied rather slowly in most countries. In addition, there are indications that energy savings are partly compensated particularly by wealth but also rebound effects, the "empty nest" (persistence of elderly people and couples in family homes), and cohort effects (e.g. vintages of people or buildings). In Germany, as in other European countries, the existing trend in housing is a continuously growing floor space per capita. Over the last decades it expanded from about 20 m2 in 1960 to currently 45 m2 per person. Forecasts expect a further increase to more than 50 m2 per person. Obviously, more floor space needs more energy for space heating and cooling, ventilation, and lighting, but it also allows the household to operate more and or bigger appliances, all of which increase energy consumption. On the other hand, housing projects emerge offering relatively small private living spaces in combination with various shared spaces to use. Many of them are based on private initiatives. But what is the motivation behind it? And is there a higher need for new living concepts in the future? The proposed paper presents main drivers of increasing floor space per capita in Germany and discusses the question if more space is necessary for higher comfort. It presents different examples of housing concepts that strive to achieve good living with less space and suggests a "building typology of sufficiency". Finally, the paper discusses qualitatively to which extent these housing concepts can lead to less energy use and emissions. In this way sufficiency could be best friend with efficiency and tackle wealth, rebound, and other effects that counter-act efficiency progress. But therefore, as the paper concludes, politics and policies should recognise sufficiency as a field of action instead of referring to individual decisions and lifestyles.},

We examine the potential impact of forest restoration on the value of multiple ecosystem services across four dryland areas in Latin America, by estimating the net value of ecosystem service benefits under different reforestation scenarios. The values of selected ecosystem services were mapped under each scenario, supported by the use of a spatially explicit model of forest dynamics. We explored the economic potential of a change in land use from livestock grazing to restored native forest using different discount rates and performed a cost--benefit analysis of three restoration scenarios. Results show that passive restoration is cost-effective for all study areas on the basis of the services analyzed, whereas the benefits from active restoration are generally outweighed by the relatively high costs involved. These findings were found to be relatively insensitive to discount rate but were sensitive to the market value of carbon. Substantial variation in values was recorded between study areas, demonstrating that ecosystem service values are strongly context specific. However, spatial analysis enabled localized areas of net benefits to be identified, indicating the value of this approach for identifying the relative costs and benefits of restoration interventions across a landscape.},

We studied the temperature regulation capacity during the two Central European extreme summers in 2018 and 2019 in Scots pine plantations and European beech forests with different management-related structural characteristics. 3. We found that the maximum temperature was higher when more trees were cut and canopy was more open. Logging 100 trees per hectare increased maximum temperature by 0.21-0.34 K at ground level and by 0.09-0.17 K in 1.3 m above ground. Opening the forest canopy by 10\% significantly increased T max, measured 1.3 m above ground by 0.46 K (including pine and beech stands) and 0.35 K (only pine stands). At ground level, T max increased by 0.53 K for the model including pine and beech stands and by 0.41 K in pure pine stands. Relative temperature cooling capacity decreased with increasing wood harvest activities, with below average values in 2018 (and 2019) when more than 656 (and 867) trees per hectare were felled.

  abstract = {Abstract. Regional cooling resulting from increases in surface albedo has been identified in several studies as the main biogeophysical effect of past land use-induced land cover changes (LCC) on climate. However, the amplitude of this effect remains quite uncertain due to, among other factors, (a) uncertainties in the extent of historical LCC and, (b) differences in the way various models simulate surface albedo and more specifically its dependency on vegetation type and snow cover. We derived monthly albedo climatologies for croplands and four other land cover types from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations. We then reconstructed the changes in surface albedo between preindustrial times and present-day by combining these climatologies with the land cover maps of 1870 and 1992 used by seven land surface models (LSMs) in the context of the LUCID ("Land Use and Climate: identification of robust Impacts") intercomparison project. These reconstructions show surface albedo increases larger than 10\% (absolute) in winter, and larger than 2\% in summer between 1870 and 1992 over areas that experienced intense deforestation in the northern temperate regions. The historical surface albedo changes estimated with MODIS data were then compared to those simulated by the various climate models participating in LUCID. The inter-model mean albedo response to LCC shows a similar spatial and seasonal pattern to the one resulting from the MODIS-based reconstructions, that is, larger albedo increases in winter than in summer, driven by the presence of snow. However, individual models show significant differences between the simulated albedo changes and the corresponding reconstructions, despite the fact that land cover change maps are the same. Our analyses suggest that the primary reason for those discrepancies is how LSMs parameterize albedo. Another reason, of secondary importance, results from differences in their simulated snow extent. Our methodology is a useful tool not only to infer observations-based historical changes in land surface variables impacted by LCC, but also to point out deficiencies of the models. We therefore suggest that it could be more widely developed and used in conjunction with other tools in order to evaluate LSMs.},

  abstract = {Changes to forest production drivers (light, water, temperature, and site nutrient) over the last 55 years have been documented in peer-reviewed literature. The main objective of this paper is to review documented evidence of the impacts of climate change trends on forest productivity since the middle of the 20th century. We first present a concise overview of the climate controls of forest production, provide evidence of how the main controls have changed in the last 55 years, followed by a core section outlining our findings of observed and documented impacts on forest productivity and a brief discussion of the complications of interpreting trends in net primary production (NPP). At finer spatial scales, a trend is difficult to decipher, but globally, based on both satellite and ground-based data, climatic changes seemed to have a generally positive impact on forest productivity when water was not limiting. Of the 49 papers reporting forest production levels we reviewed, 37 showed a positive growth trend, five a negative trend, three reported both a positive and a negative trend for different time periods, one reported a positive and no trend for different geographic areas, and two reported no trend. Forests occupy {$\approx$} 52\% of the Earth's land surface and tend to occupy more temperature and radiation-limited environments. Less than 7\% of forests are in strongly water-limited systems. The combined and interacting effects of temperature, radiation, and precipitation changes with the positive effect of CO2, the negative effects of O3 and other pollutants, and the presently positive effects of N will not be elucidated with experimental manipulation of one or a few factors at a time. Assessments of the greening of the biosphere depend on both accurate measurements of rates (net ecosystem exchange, NPP), how much is stored at the ecosystem level (net ecosystem production) and quantification of disturbances rates on final net biome production. {\copyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change.},

An ensemble machine learning model based on stacked regularization was used, with multinomial logistic regression as the meta-learner and spatial blocking (100 km) to deal with spatial autocorrelation of the training points. Results of spatial cross-validation for the BIOME 6000 classes show an overall accuracy of 0.67 and R 2 logloss of 0.61, with ``tropical evergreen broadleaf forest'' being the class with highest gain in predictive performances (R 2 logloss = 0.74) and ``prostrate dwarf shrub tundra'' the class with the lowest (R 2 logloss = -0.09) compared to the baseline. Temperature-related covariates were the most important predictors, with the mean diurnal range (BIO2) being shared by all the base-learners ( i.e. ,random forest, gradient boosted trees and generalized linear models). The model was next used to predict the distribution of future biomes for the periods 2040--2060 and 2061--2080 under three climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5). Comparisons of predictions for the three epochs (present, 2040--2060 and 2061--2080) show that increasing aridity and higher temperatures will likely result in significant shifts in natural vegetation in the tropical area (shifts from tropical forests to savannas up to 1.7 {\texttimes}10 5 km 2 by 2080) and around the Arctic Circle (shifts from tundra to boreal forests up to 2.4 {\texttimes}10 5 km 2 by 2080). Projected global maps at 1 km spatial resolution are provided as probability and hard classes maps for BIOME 6000 classes and as hard classes maps for the IUCN classes (six aggregated classes). Uncertainty maps (prediction error) are also provided and should be used for careful interpretation of the future projections.},

  abstract = {In order to better assess the role of agriculture within the global climate-vegetation system, we present a model of the managed planetary land surface, Lund--Potsdam--Jena managed Land (LPJmL), which simulates biophysical and biogeochemical processes as well as productivity and yield of the most important crops worldwide, using a concept of crop functional types (CFTs). Based on the LPJ-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, LPJmL simulates the transient changes in carbon and water cycles due to land use, the specific phenology and seasonal CO 2 fluxes of agricultural-dominated areas, and the production of crops and grazing land. It uses 13 CFTs (11 arable crops and two managed grass types), with specific parameterizations of phenology connected to leaf area development. Carbon is allocated daily towards four carbon pools, one being the yield-bearing storage organs. Management (irrigation, treatment of residues, intercropping) can be considered in order to capture their effect on productivity, on soil organic carbon and on carbon extracted from the ecosystem. For transient simulations for the 20th century, a global historical land use data set was developed, providing the annual cover fraction of the 13 CFTs, rain-fed and/or irrigated, within 0.5{$^\circ$} grid cells for the period 1901--2000, using published data on land use, crop distributions and irrigated areas. Several key results are compared with observations. The simulated spatial distribution of sowing dates for temperate cereals is comparable with the reported crop calendars. The simulated seasonal canopy development agrees better with satellite observations when actual cropland distribution is taken into account. Simulated yields for temperate cereals and maize compare well with FAO statistics. Monthly carbon fluxes measured at three agricultural sites also compare well with simulations. Global simulations indicate a {$\sim$}24\% (respectively {$\sim$}10\%) reduction in global vegetation (respectively soil) carbon due to agriculture, and 6--9 Pg C of yearly harvested biomass in the 1990s. In contrast to simulations of the potential natural vegetation showing the land biosphere to be an increasing carbon sink during the 20th century, LPJmL simulates a net carbon source until the 1970s (due to land use), and a small sink (mostly due to changing climate and CO 2 ) after 1970. This is comparable with earlier LPJ simulations using a more simple land use scheme, and within the uncertainty range of estimates in the 1980s and 1990s. The fluxes attributed to land use change compare well with Houghton's estimates on the land use related fluxes until the 1970s, but then they begin to diverge, probably due to the different rates of deforestation considered. The simulated impacts of agriculture on the global water cycle for the 1990s are{$\sim$}5\% (respectively{$\sim$}20\%) reduction in transpiration (respectively interception), and{$\sim$}44\% increase in evaporation. Global runoff, which includes a simple irrigation scheme, is practically not affected.},

  abstract = {In this paper, primary energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from the construction of a multi-storey building, with either a wood or a concrete frame, were calculated from life-cycle and forest land-use perspectives. The primary energy input (mainly fossil fuels) in the production of building materials was found to be about 60-80\% higher when concrete frames were considered instead of wood frames. The net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for wood materials will depend strongly on how the wood is handled after demolition of the building. The net GHG balance will be slightly positive if all the demolition wood is used to replace fossil fuels, slightly negative if part of the demolition wood is re-used, and clearly positive if all wood is deposited in landfills, due to the production of CH4. However, if the biogas produced is collected and used to replace fossil fuels, the net GHG emissions will be insignificant. If concrete frames are used, the net GHG emissions will be about those when demolition wood from the wood-framed building is deposited in landfills and no biogas is collected. We have considered that the CO2 released from the chemical processes in the production of cement will be re-bound to the concrete by the carbonisation process. Otherwise, the net GHG emission would be more than twice as high when concrete frames are used. If forest biomass is used instead of fossil fuels, the net area of forest land required to supply both raw material and energy for the production of building materials, will be about twice as high when wood frames are used instead of concrete frames. However, the GHG mitigation efficiency, expressed as CO2 equivalents per unit area of forest land, will be 2-3 times higher when wood frames are used if excess wood waste and logging residues are used to replace fossil fuels. The excess forest in the concrete frame alternative is used to replace fossil fuels, but if this forest is used for carbon storage, the mitigation efficiency will be higher for the first forest rotation period (100 yr), but lower for the following rotation periods. Some of the data used in the analyses are uncertain, but an understanding of the complexity in comparing different alternatives for utilising forest for GHG mitigation, and of the fact that the time perspective applied affects the results markedly, is more important for the results than the precise figures in the input data.

While many studies have been conducted on this issue, there is limited empirical evidence on how feeding affects damage caused by wildlife. In this context, the present study focused on the effect of artificial winter feeding on tree damage in three mountain regions in Poland. RESULTS: The presence of additional winter food did not increase tree damage caused by deer in any region, as expected. Moreover, we observed that additional feeding mitigated forest damage in one region, where the highest level of deer impact had occurred. However, in this mountain region, the most important factor was elevation, which was used to classify additional feeding practice as efficient or inefficient. In the two other study regions, we did not observe any effect of supplementary feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Additional winter supplementary feeding can reduce damage caused by deer in forest stands, but only in areas with high deer pressure. Moreover, feeders should be situated in locations {$>$} 600 m above sea level in our study area. {\copyright} 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.},

Results from four earth system models (ESMs) are analyzed for the future RCP8.5 scenario from simulations with and without land-use and land cover change (LULCC), contributing to the Land-Use and Climate, IDentification of robust impacts (LUCID) project. Over the period 2006-2100, LULCC causes the atmospheric CO2concentration to increase by 12, 22, and 66 ppm in CanESM2, MIROC-ESM, and MPI-ESM-LR, respectively. Statistically significant changes in global near-surface temperature are found in three models with a BGC-induced global mean annual warming between 0.07 and 0.23 K. BGP-induced responses are simulated by three models in areas of intense LULCC of varying sign and magnitude (between g 0.47 and 0.10 K). Modifications of the land carbon pool by LULCC are disentangled in accordance with processes that can lead to increases and decreases in this carbon pool. Global land carbon losses due to LULCC are simulated by all models: 218, 57, 35 and 34 Gt C by MPI-ESM-LR, MIROC-ESM, IPSL-CM5A-LR and CanESM2, respectively. On the contrary, the CO2-fertilization effect caused by elevated atmospheric CO2concentrations due to LULCC leads to a land carbon gain of 39 Gt C in MPI-ESM-LR and is almost negligible in the other models. A substantial part of the spread in models' responses to LULCC is attributed to the differences in implementation of LULCC (e.g., whether pastures or crops are simulated explicitly) and the simulation of specific processes. Simple idealized experiments with clear protocols for implementing LULCC in ESMs are needed to increase the understanding of model responses and the statistical significance of results, especially when analyzing the regional-scale impacts of LULCC.},

This study quantified how forest carbon stocks responded to stand-replacing blowdown and wildfire, both individually and in combination with and without post-disturbance salvage operations, in a sub-boreal jack pine ecosystem. Individually, blowdown or fire caused similar decreases in live carbon and total ecosystem carbon. However, whereas blowdown increased carbon in down woody material and forest floor, fire increased carbon in standing snags, a difference that may have consequences for long-term carbon cycling patterns. Fire after the blowdown caused substantial additional reduction in ecosystem carbon stocks, suggesting that potential increases in multiple disturbance events may represent a challenge for sustaining ecosystem carbon stocks. Salvage logging, as examined here, decreased carbon stored in snags and down woody material but had no significant effect on total ecosystem carbon stocks. {\copyright} 2011.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Biological sequestration can increase the carbon stocks of non-atmospheric reservoirs (e.g. land and land-based products). Since this contained carbon is sequestered from, and retained outside, the atmosphere for a period of time, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is temporarily reduced and some radiative forcing is avoided. Carbon removal from the atmosphere and storage in the biosphere or anthroposphere, therefore, has the potential to mitigate climate change, even if the carbon storage and associated benefits might be temporary. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting (CF) are increasingly popular tools for the environmental assessment of products, that take into account their entire life cycle. There have been significant efforts to develop robust methods to account for the benefits, if any, of sequestration and temporary storage and release of biogenic carbon. However, there is still no overall consensus on the most appropriate ways of considering and quantifying it. Method: This paper reviews and discusses six available methods for accounting for the potential climate impacts of carbon sequestration and temporary storage or release of biogenic carbon in LCA and CF. Several viewpoints and approaches are presented in a structured manner to help decision-makers in their selection of an option from competing approaches for dealing with timing issues, including delayed emissions of fossil carbon. Results: Key issues identified are that the benefits of temporary carbon removals depend on the time horizon adopted when assessing climate change impacts and are therefore not purely science-based but include value judgments. We therefore did not recommend a preferred option out of the six alternatives presented here. Conclusions: Further work is needed to combine aspects of scientific and socio-economic understanding with value judgements and ethical considerations. {\copyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Due to climate change for many regions an increase in tree mortality is expected. Considering changes in mortality risk is important for management decisions. Therefore, models are needed that predict mortality risk under future climate. We fitted survival models for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Silver Fir (Abies alba Mill.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.), and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) based on the German crown condition survey as well as pan-European crown condition data from Level I and Level II plots, thus encompassing large environmental gradients. We used parametric accelerated failure time models assuming Weibull- or log-normal distribution of survival times. The models allow to estimate survival probability in dependence on age, climate and species mixture. For all species, a decrease in survival probability with increasing temperatures was found. Decreasing precipitation increased mortality risk for Norway spruce, Scots pine and Douglas fir. In addition, for Norway spruce and Douglas fir a positive effect of species admixture on survival was found. In summary, we could fit parsimonious parametric survival models explaining differences in survival times by 30-year climate averages that we interpret as predisposing factors that increase a tree's vulnerability. However, uncertainty in estimations remains high due to limitations of the sampling design and the methodology.},

  abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is the total one-sided area of leaf tissue per unit ground surface area. It is a key parameter in ecophysiology, especially for scaling up the gas exchange from leaf to canopy level. It characterizes the canopy-atmosphere interface, where most of the energy fluxes exchange. It is also one of the most difficult to quantify properly, owing to large spatial and temporal variability. Many methods have been developed to quantify LAI from the ground and some of them are also suitable for describing other structural parameters of the canopy. This paper reviews the direct and indirect methods, the required instruments, their advantages, disadvantages and accuracy of the results. Analysis of the literature shows that most cross-validations between direct and indirect methods have pointed to a significant underestimation of LAI with the latter techniques, especially in forest stands. The two main causes for the discrepancy, clumping and contribution of stem and branches, are discussed and some recent theoretical or technical solutions are presented as potential improvements to reduce bias or discrepancies. The accuracy, sampling strategy and spatial validity of the LAI measurements have to be assessed for quality assurance of both the measurement and the modelling purposes of all the LAI-dependent ecophysiological and biophysical processes of canopies.},

  abstract = {The extreme drought event that occurred in Western Europe during 2003 highlighted the need to understand the key processes that may allow trees and stands to overcome such severe water shortages. We therefore reviewed the current knowledge available about such processes. First, impact of drought on exchanges at soil-root and canopy-atmosphere interfaces are presented and illustrated with examples fromwater and CO2 flux measurements. The decline in transpiration and water uptake and in net carbon assimilation due to stomatal closure has been quantified and modelled. The resulting models were used to compute water balance at stand level basing on the 2003 climate in nine European forest sites from the CARBOEUROPE network. Estimates of soil water deficit were produced and provided a quantitative index of soil water shortage and therefore of the intensity of drought stress experienced by trees during summer 2003. In a second section, we review the irreversible damage that could be imposed on water transfer within trees and particularly within xylem. A special attention was paid to the inter-specific variability of these properties among a wide range of tree species. The inter-specific diversity of hydraulic and stomatal responses to soil water deficit is also discussed as it might reflect a large diversity in traits potentially related to drought tolerance. Finally, tree decline and mortality due to recurrent or extreme drought events are discussed on the basis of a literature review and recent decline studies. The potential involvement of hydraulic dysfunctions or of deficits in carbon storage as causes for the observed long term (several years) decline of tree growth and development and for the onset of tree dieback is discussed. As an example, the starch content in stem tissues recorded at the end of the 2003's summer was used to predict crown conditions of oak trees during the following spring: low starch contents were correlated with large twig and branch decline in the crown of trees. {\copyright} INRA, EDP Sciences, 2006.},

  abstract = {The particular European perspective on current forest and water issues is outlined in three focal areas: water supply, water quality, and water-related hazards. Much of the synopsis relies on contributions brought together within the European COST consortium `Forest management and the water cycle', which is operating from 2007 to 2011. Under the currently projected climate change (CC) scenarios for Europe, the humidity gradient across the sub-continent from moist Northwest to dry Southeast will probably intensify, bringing about potentially more flooding problems at the `wet end', and more drought and related problems (wildfires, salination) at the `dry end'. Careful planning of management is essential wherever tradeoff situations between forest growth and water yield emerge. The water quality issue in Europe is not as pressing as it was a few decades ago. Much has been achieved on account of successful water- and air-pollution control. Particularly, the acidification pressure on forest soils and their water-related systems was much relieved, due to strongly declining acidic deposition over the past 30 years. Forests and their appropriate management for optimizing water retention can support flood control, but with clear limitations under very strong and catastrophic events. The contribution to flood control is more important under `normal' conditions than under extremes. Important controls are infiltration capacity and the status of water saturation prior to the rain event, i.e. the still available storage capacity. The safeguarding of water quality is seen as the most important single aspect among forest-water relations. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide records indicate that the land surface has acted as a strong global carbon sink over recent decades, with a substantial fraction of this sink probably located in the tropics, particularly in the Amazon. Nevertheless, it is unclear how the terrestrial carbon sink will evolve as climate and atmospheric composition continue to change. Here we analyse the historical evolution of the biomass dynamics of the Amazon rainforest over three decades using a distributed network of 321 plots. While this analysis confirms that Amazon forests have acted as a long-term net biomass sink, we find a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation. Rates of net increase in above-ground biomass declined by one-third during the past decade compared to the 1990s. This is a consequence of growth rate increases levelling off recently, while biomass mortality persistently increased throughout, leading to a shortening of carbon residence times. Potential drivers for the mortality increase include greater climate variability, and feedbacks of faster growth on mortality, resulting in shortened tree longevity. The observed decline of the Amazon sink diverges markedly from the recent increase in terrestrial carbon uptake at the global scale, and is contrary to expectations based on models.},

Extant models predict that this growth stimulation will continue to cause a net carbon uptake this century. However, there are indications that increased growth rates may shorten trees{$\prime$} lifespan and thus recent increases in forest carbon stocks may be transient due to lagged increases in mortality. Here we show that growth-lifespan trade-offs are indeed near universal, occurring across almost all species and climates. This trade-off is directly linked to faster growth reducing tree lifespan, and not due to covariance with climate or environment. Thus, current tree growth stimulation will, inevitably, result in a lagged increase in canopy tree mortality, as is indeed widely observed, and eventually neutralise carbon gains due to growth stimulation. Results from a strongly data-based forest simulator confirm these expectations. Extant Earth system model projections of global forest carbon sink persistence are likely too optimistic, increasing the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions.},

There is increasing evidence that biodiversity contributes to forest ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. Here we provide a review of forest ecosystem services including biomass production, habitat provisioning services, pollination, seed dispersal, resistance to wind storms, fire regulation and mitigation, pest regulation of native and invading insects, carbon sequestration, and cultural ecosystem services, in relation to forest type, structure and diversity. We also consider relationships between forest biodiversity and multifunctionality, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. We compare the concepts of ecosystem processes, functions and services to clarify their definitions. Our review of published studies indicates a lack of empirical studies that establish quantitative and causal relationships between forest biodiversity and many important ecosystem services. The literature is highly skewed; studies on provisioning of nutrition and energy, and on cultural services, delivered by mixed-species forests are under-represented. Planted forests offer ample opportunity for optimising their composition and diversity because replanting after harvesting is a recurring process. Planting mixed-species forests should be given more consideration as they are likely to provide a wider range of ecosystem services within the forest and for adjacent land uses. This review also serves as the introduction to this special issue of Biodiversity and Conservation on various aspects of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

Central to the success of trees are their woody bodies, which connect their elevated photosynthetic canopies with the essential belowground activities of water and nutrient acquisition. The slow construction of these carbon-dense, woody skeletons leads to a slow generation time, leaving trees and forests highly susceptible to rapid changes in climate. Other long-lived, sessile organisms such as corals appear to be poorly equipped to survive rapid changes, which raises questions about the vulnerability of contemporary forests to future climate change. The emerging view that, similar to corals, tree species have rather inflexible damage thresholds, particularly in terms of water stress, is especially concerning.

The NDVI dynamics and range of MODIS NDVI data at 1{$^\circ$} is matched and extended through the AVHRR record. Four years of overlap between the two sensors is used to train a neural network to remove atmospheric and sensor specific effects on the AVHRR NDVI.

Our innovative modelling approach also included the elimination of eternal recycling loops, the inclusion of more realistic wood use cascading scenarios, and adoption of a more realistic marginal (ceteris paribus) substitution approach. Results show that the mitigation effect derived from material substitution is 33\% lower in 2030 than previously predicted, and even 96\% lower in 2100, showing its expiry date by the end of the century. Nevertheless, the mitigation effect of wood product use, in addition to mitigation by forests, may represent 3.3\% of the European emission reduction targets by 2030.},

  abstract = {In order to map the spatial distribution of twenty tree species groups over Europe at 1 km {\texttimes} 1 km resolution, the ICP-Forest Level-I plot data were extended with the National Forest Inventory (NFI) plot data of eighteen countries. The NFI grids have a much smaller spacing than the ICP grid. In areas with NFI plot data, the proportions of the land area covered by the tree species were mapped by compositional kriging. Outside these areas, these proportions were mapped with a multinomial multiple logistic regression model. A soil map, a biogeographical map and bioindicators derived from temperature and precipitation data were used as predictors. Both methods ensure that the predicted proportions are in the interval [0,1] and sum to 1. The regression predictions were iteratively scaled to the National Forest Inventory statistics and the Forest map of Europe. The predicted proportions for the twenty tree species were validated by the Bhattacharryya distance between predicted and observed proportions at 230 plot data separated from the calibration data. Besides, the map with the predicted dominant species was validated by computing the error matrix. The median Bhattacharryya distance in the subarea with NFI plot data was 1. 712, whereas in the subarea with ICP-Level-I data, this was 2. 131. The scaling did not significantly decrease the Bhattacharryya distance. The estimated overall accuracy of this map was 43\%. In areas with NFI plot data, overall accuracy was 57\%, outside these areas 33\%. This gain was mainly attributable to the much denser plot data, less to the prediction method. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

This study aims to present the state of the art on forestry MES at the international level through a systematic review. The main objectives are (i) to analyse the distribution of actual or potential markets for forest ecosystem services (FES) that exist internationally today, (ii) to identify the spatial scale at which market-based instruments (MBIs) are applied and the respective measures of economic value used to assess FES, and (iii) to identify the actors and their involvement in the implementation of forestry MES. The study collected 304 peer-reviewed publications using the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol was used to guide the systematic process and select the 52 articles analysed in the review. The results show that Europe is the most representative continent in terms of geographical areas involved ( n = 8) by forestry MES, followed by America ( n = 6), Asia ( n = 5), and Africa ( n = 1). The main scale of application of MBIs for forestry MES is local, i.e., at the level of forest stand, municipality, or province ( n = 31), followed by subnational ( n = 10), national ( n = 9), and international ( n = 2). The main pattern of social composition in forestry MES is buyers, sellers, and intermediaries ( n = 25), followed by buyers and sellers only ( n = 12), buyers, sellers, intermediaries, and knowledge providers ( n = 5), and buyers, sellers, and knowledge providers ( n = 3). In terms of the measure of economic value, most studies use willingness to accept ( n = 30), as opposed to willingness to pay ( n = 17), and only 5 studies used both. Future research on forestry MES should be directed towards a better understanding of the process leading to their creation, implementation, effectiveness, governance, and level of satisfaction in economic terms of the actors involved.}

  abstract = {The concept of ecological resilience is an invaluable tool to assess the risk of state transitions and predict the impact of management on an ecosystem's response to future disturbances. However, resilience is difficult to quantify and the factors contributing to resilience are often unknown in systems subject to multiple disturbances. Here, we develop and demonstrate a framework to assess the potential of ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forests to be resilient to future disturbance (recover as the same forest type within a managerially significant timeframe) by combining indicators of short-term resilience (ability to withstand disturbance) to fire, insect, and drought disturbances using data from the Rio Tusas-Lower San Antonio landscape in northern New Mexico. The dry mixed conifer forests displayed an average resilience score of 4.54, while ponderosa pine forests had an average score of 3.45 (total possible of nine points) Stand density index was the most important driver of the overall score in the dry mixed conifer type. In the ponderosa pine type, overall basal area was the strongest driver of the overall score. These indicators have the greatest impact on the resilience score and provide the most effective targets for management to increase the possibility of resilience in these forest types. We applied the model in both forest types by comparing individual stands to an `ideal' score for a stand that is within the historic range of variation (HRV) of forest structure for each forest type and confirmed that stands outside of HRV had a low possibility of resilience and stands that had received restoration-based treatments were more likely to be resilient. Our results provide evidence that the changes to forest structure and species composition that have occurred since the onset of fire exclusion have degraded the potential of these forest types to be resilient to future fire, insect, and drought-related disturbances. By modifying disturbances and resilience indicator thresholds this model can be applied to assess resilience to other disturbances within these forest types and across various regions and ecosystem types.},

However, relatively little is known about the GHG mitigation potential in agriculture, in particular with respect to the combined effects of technological advancements and dietary changes. Here, we estimate the extent to which changes in technology and demand can reduce Swedish food-related GHG emissions necessary for meeting EU climate targets. This analysis is based on a detailed representation of the food and agriculture system, using 30 different food items. We find that food-related methane and nitrous oxide emissions can be reduced enough to meet the EU 2050 climate targets. Technologically, agriculture can improve in productivity and through implementation of specific mitigation measures. Under optimistic assumptions, these developments could cut current food-related methane and nitrous oxide emissions by nearly 50\%. However, also dietary changes will almost certainly be necessary. Large reductions, by 50\% or more, in ruminant meat (beef and mutton) consumption are, most likely, unavoidable if the EU targets are to be met. In contrast, continued high per-capita consumption of pork and poultry meat or dairy products might be accommodated within the climate targets. High dairy consumption, however, is only compatible with the targets if there are substantial advances in technology. Reducing food waste plays a minor role for meeting the climate targets, lowering emissions only by an additional 1--3\%.},

Since the late 1980s, three iterations of this land cover inventories have been realised (timed around 1990, 2000 and 2006). The 4th inventory recently commenced, as part of the GIO land (GMES Initial Operations Land) project. CLC is widely used in indicator development, environmental modelling and land use/land cover change analysis in the European context. The number of participating countries has increased over time -- currently 39, including 32 European Environment Agency (EEA) member countries and seven cooperating countries, with a total area coverage of 5,8 Mkm2. Ortho-corrected high spatial resolution satellite images provide the geometrical basis for mapping. In-situ data (e.g. topographic maps, ortho-photos, and ground survey data) are essential ancillary information. The project is mainly co-financed by the European Commission and participating countries and implemented by national teams under the management and quality control of EEA. The basic technical parameters of CLC (i.e. nomenclature, 25 ha minimum mapping unit and 100 m minimum mapping width) have not changed since the beginning of the project; therefore the results of the different inventories are comparable. The method of mapping has, however, changed significantly. Working on plastic overlay at the start was fully replaced by computer assisted photo-interpretation (CAPI). In the Scandinavian countries and recently in Germany and Ireland, labour-intensive photo-interpretation was partly substituted by a semi-automatic classification methodology based on the integration of existing land use data, satellite image processing and generalization. CORINE Land Cover Changes (CLCC) are derived from satellite imagery by the direct mapping of changes based on image-to-image comparison. Change mapping applies a 5 ha MMU to pick up much more detail in CLCC layer than in CLC status layer. Two European validation studies have shown that the achieved accuracy is above the specified minimum (85 {\textbackslash}\%) for CLC, as well as for CLCC. Results of the three CLC inventories can be downloaded from the EEA Data Service free of charge for all users. One of the proposed ways to increase the value of CLC in the future is to populate landscape level objects of the CLC database with high spatial resolution land cover features. The GIO land project is making the first steps towards this.},

  abstract = {Forest gap models, initially conceived in 1969 as a special case of individual-tree based models, have become widely popular among forest ecologists for addressing a large number of applied research questions, including the impacts of global change on long-term dynamics of forest structure, biomass, and composition. However, they have been strongly criticized for a number of weaknesses inherent in the original model structure. In this paper, I review the fundamental assumptions underlying forest gap models, the structure of the parent model JABOWA, and examine these criticisms in the context of the many alternative formulations that have been developed over the past 30 years. Four assumptions originally underlie gap models: (1) The forest is abstracted as a composite of many small patches of land, where each can have a different age and successional stage; (2) patches are horizontally homogeneous, i.e., tree position within a patch is not considered; (3) the leaves of each tree are located in an indefinitely thin layer (disk) at the top of the stem; and (4) successional processes are described on each patch separately, i.e., there are no interactions between patches. These simplifications made it possible to consider mixed-species, mixed-age forests, which had been difficult previously mainly because of computing limitations. The structure of JABOWA is analysed in terms of the functional relationships used for formulating the processes of tree establishment, growth, and mortality. It is concluded that JABOWA contains a number of unrealistic assumptions that have not been questioned strongly to date. At the same time, some aspects of JABOWA that were criticized strongly in the past years are internally consistent given the objectives of this specific model. A wide variety of formulations for growth processes, establishment, and mortality factors have been developed in gap models over the past 30 years, and modern gap models include more robust parameterizations of environmental influences on tree growth and population dynamics as compared to JABOWA. Approaches taken in more recent models that led to the relaxation of one or several of the four basic assumptions are discussed. It is found that the original assumptions often have been replaced by alternatives; however, no systematic analysis of the behavioral effects of these conceptual changes has been attempted to date. The feasibility of including more physiological detail (instead of using relatively simple parameterizations) in forest gap models is discussed, and it is concluded that we often lack the data base to implement such approaches for more than a few commercially important tree species. Hence, it is important to find a compromise between using simplistic parameterizations and expanding gap models with physiology-based functions and parameters that are difficult to estimate. While the modeling of tree growth has received a lot of attention over the past years, much less effort has been spent on improving the formulations of tree establishment and mortality, although these processes are likely to be just as sensitive to global change as tree growth itself. Finally, model validation issues are discussed, and it is found that there is no single data source that can reliably be used for evaluating the behavior of forest gap models; instead, I propose a combination of sensitivity analyses, qualitative examinations of process formulations, and quantitative tests of gap models or selected submodels against various kinds of empirical data to evaluate the usefulness of these models for assessing their utility for predicting the impacts of global change on long-term forest dynamics.},

  abstract = {Experimental studies suggest that tree growth is stimulated in a greenhouse atmosphere, leading to faster carbon accumulation (i. e., a higher rate of gap filling). However, higher growth may be coupled with reduced longevity, thus leading to faster carbon release (i. e., a higher rate of gap creation). The net effect of these two counteracting processes is not known. We quantify this net effect on aboveground carbon stocks using a novel combination of data sets and modeling. Data on maximum growth rate and maximum longevity of 141 temperate tree species are used to derive a relationship between growth stimulation and changes in longevity. We employ this relationship to modify the respective parameter values of tree species in a forest succession model and study aboveground biomass in a factorial design of growth stimulation {\texttimes} reduced maximum longevity at multiple sites along a climate gradient from the cold to the dry treeline. The results show that (1) any growth stimulation at the tree level leads to a disproportionately small increase of stand biomass due to negative feedback effects, even in the absence of reduced longevity; (2) a reduction of tree longevity tends to offset the growth-related biomass increase; at the most likely value of reduced longevity, the net effect is very close to zero in most multi- and single-species simulations; and (3) when averaging the response across all sites to mimic a "landscape-level" response, the net effect is close to zero. Thus, it is important to consider ecophysiological responses with their linkage to demographic processes in forest trees if one wishes to avoid erroneous inference at the ecosystem level. We conclude that any CO2 fertilization effect is quite likely to be offset by an associated reduction in the longevity of forest trees, thus strongly reducing the carbon mitigation potential of temperate forests. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

We introduce the concept and selection of case study areas (CSAs) that were used in the project; we describe the concept of representative stand types that were developed to provide a harmonized representation of forest stands and forest management in the CSAs; we explain and discuss the climate data and climate change scenarios that were applied across the seven CSAs; and we introduce the linker functions that were developed to relate stand- and landscape-scale forest features from model simulations to ES provisioning in mountain forests. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the Special Feature, with an attempt to synthesize emerging response patterns across the CSAs.},

  abstract = {Models are pivotal for assessing future forest dynamics under the impacts of changing climate and management practices, incorporating representations of tree growth, mortality, and regeneration. Quantitative studies on the importance of mortality submodels are scarce. We evaluated 15 dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) regarding their sensitivity to different formulations of tree mortality under different degrees of climate change. The set of models comprised eight DVMs at the stand scale, three at the landscape scale, and four typically applied at the continental to global scale. Some incorporate empirically derived mortality models, and others are based on experimental data, whereas still others are based on theoretical reasoning. Each DVM was run with at least two alternative mortality submodels. Model behavior was evaluated against empirical time series data, and then, the models were subjected to different scenarios of climate change. Most DVMs matched empirical data quite well, irrespective of the mortality submodel that was used. However, mortality submodels that performed in a very similar manner against past data often led to sharply different trajectories of forest dynamics under future climate change. Most DVMs featured high sensitivity to the mortality submodel, with deviations of basal area and stem numbers on the order of 10--40\% per century under current climate and 20--170\% under climate change. The sensitivity of a given DVM to scenarios of climate change, however, was typically lower by a factor of two to three. We conclude that (1) mortality is one of the most uncertain processes when it comes to assessing forest response to climate change, and (2) more data and a better process understanding of tree mortality are needed to improve the robustness of simulated future forest dynamics. Our study highlights that comparing several alternative mortality formulations in DVMs provides valuable insights into the effects of process uncertainties on simulated future forest dynamics.},

Thus, in this paper we review the current state-of-the-art of CO2 capture, transport, utilisation and storage from a multi-scale perspective, moving from the global to molecular scales. In light of the COP21 commitments to limit warming to less than 2 {$^\circ$}C, we extend the remit of this study to include the key negative emissions technologies (NETs) of bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), and direct air capture (DAC). Cognisant of the non-technical barriers to deploying CCS, we reflect on recent experience from the UK's CCS commercialisation programme and consider the commercial and political barriers to the large-scale deployment of CCS. In all areas, we focus on identifying and clearly articulating the key research challenges that could usefully be addressed in the coming decade.},

Here, we identify forests in the western conterminous United States with high potential carbon sequestration and low vulnerability to future drought and fire, as simulated using the Community Land Model and two high carbon emission scenario (RCP 8.5) climate models. High-productivity, low-vulnerability forests have the potential to sequester up to 5,450 Tg CO2 equivalent (1,485 Tg C) by 2099, which is up to 20\% of the global mitigation potential previously identified for all temperate and boreal forests, or up to {\textasciitilde}6 yr of current regional fossil fuel emissions. Additionally, these forests currently have high above- and belowground carbon density, high tree species richness, and a high proportion of critical habitat for endangered vertebrate species, indicating a strong potential to support biodiversity into the future and promote ecosystem resilience to climate change. We stress that some forest lands have low carbon sequestration potential but high biodiversity, underscoring the need to consider multiple criteria when designing a land preservation portfolio. Our work demonstrates how process models and ecological criteria can be used to prioritize landscape preservation for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and preserving biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate.},

Clusters of closely spaced eddy covariance towers (e.g., {$<$}10 km) over a variety of land cover and land use types provide a unique opportunity to study the local effects of land cover and land use on surface temperature. We assess contributions albedo, energy redistribution due to differences in surface roughness and energy redistribution due to differences in the Bowen ratio using two eddy covariance tower clusters and the coupled (land-atmosphere) Variable-Resolution Community Earth System Model. Results suggest that surface roughness is the dominant biophysical factor contributing to differences in surface temperature between forested and deforested lands. Surface temperature of open land is cooler (-4.8 {$^\circ$}C to -0.05 {$^\circ$}C) than forest at night and warmer (+0.16 {$^\circ$}C to +8.2 {$^\circ$}C) during the day at northern and southern tower clusters throughout the year, consistent with modeled calculations. At annual timescales, the biophysical contributions of albedo and Bowen ratio have a negligible impact on surface temperature, however the higher albedo of snow-covered open land compared to forest leads to cooler winter surface temperatures over open lands (-0.4 {$^\circ$}C to -0.8 {$^\circ$}C). In both the models and observation, the difference in mid-day surface temperature calculated from the sum of the individual biophysical factors is greater than the difference in surface temperature calculated from radiative temperature and potential temperature. Differences in measured and modeled air temperature at the blending height, assumptions about independence of biophysical factors, and model biases in surface energy fluxes may contribute to daytime biases.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach - the Principal Component Gradient Analysis (PCGA) - to detect ecological gradients in time-series populations, i.e. several time-series originating from different individuals of a population. Detection of ecological gradients is of particular importance when dealing with time-series from heterogeneous populations which express differing trends. PCGA makes use of polar coordinates of loadings from the first two axes obtained by principal component analysis (PCA) to define groups of similar trends. Based on the mean inter-series correlation (rbar) the gain of increasing a common underlying signal by PCGA groups is quantified using Monte Carlo Simulations. In terms of validation PCGA is compared to three other existing approaches. Focusing on dendrochronological examples, PCGA is shown to correctly determine population gradients and in particular cases to be advantageous over other considered methods. Furthermore, PCGA groups in each example allowed for enhancing the strength of a common underlying signal and comparably well as hierarchical cluster analysis. Our results indicate that PCGA potentially allows for a better understanding of mechanisms causing time-series population gradients as well as objectively enhancing the performance of climate transfer functions in dendroclimatology. While our examples highlight the relevance of PCGA to the field of dendrochronology, we believe that also other disciplines working with data of comparable structure may benefit from PCGA.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to exacerbate the frequency of drought-induced tree mortality world-wide. To better predict the associated change of species composition and forest dynamics on various scales and develop adequate adaptation strategies, more information on the mechanisms driving the often observed patchiness of tree die-back is needed. Although forest-edge effects may play an important role within the given context, only few corresponding studies exist. Here, we investigate the regional die-back of Scots pine in Franconia, Germany, after a hot and dry summer in 2015, thereby emphasizing possible differences in mortality between forest edge and interior. By means of dendroecological investigations and close-range remote sensing, we assess long-term growth performance and current tree vitality along five different forest-edge distance gradients. Our results clearly indicate a differing growth performance between edge and interior trees, associated with a higher vulnerability to drought, increased mortality rates, and lower tree vitality at the forest edge. Prior long-lasting growth decline of dead trees compared to live trees suggests depletion of carbon reserves in course of a long-term drought persisting since the 1990s to be the cause of regional Scots pine die-back. These findings highlight the forest edge as a potential focal point of forest management adaptation strategies in the context of drought-induced mortality.},

  abstract = {Climate change poses certain threats to the World's forests. That is, tree performance declines if species-specific, climatic thresholds are surpassed. Prominent climatic changes negatively affecting tree performance are mainly associated with so-called hotter droughts. In combination with biotic pathogens, hotter droughts cause a higher tree vulnerability and thus mortality. As a consequence, global forests are expected to undergo vast changes in the course of climate change. Changed climatic conditions may on the one hand locally result in more frequent dieback of a particular tree species but on the other hand allow other---locally yet absent species---to establish themselves, thereby potentially changing local tree-species diversity. Although several studies provide valuable insights into potential risks of prominent European tree species, we yet lack a comprehensive assessment on how and to which extent the composition of European forests may change. To overcome this research gap, we here project future tree-species compositions of European forests. We combine the concept of climate analogs with national forest inventory data to project the tree-species composition for the 26 most important European tree species at any given location in Europe for the period 2061--2090 and the two most relevant CMIP5 scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Our results indicate significant changes in European forests species compositions. Species richness generally declined in the Mediterranean and Central European lowlands, while Scandinavian and Central European high-elevation forests were projected an increasing diversity. Moreover, 76\% (RCP 4.5) and 80\% (RCP 8.5) of the investigated locations indicated a decreasing abundance of the locally yet most abundant tree species while 74 and 68\% were projected an increasing tree-species diversity. Altogether, our study confirms the expectation of European forests undergoing remarkable changes until the end of the 21st century (i.e., 2061--2090) and provides a scientific basement for climate change adaptation with important implications for forestry and nature conservation.},

  abstract = {Forest decline, in course of climate change, has become a frequently observed phenomenon. Much of the observed decline has been associated with an increasing frequency of climate change induced hotter droughts while decline induced by flooding, late-frost, and storms also play an important role. As a consequence, tree mortality rates have increased across the globe. Despite numerous studies that have assessed forest decline and predisposing factors for tree mortality, we still lack an in-depth understanding of (I) underlying eco-physiological mechanisms, (II) the influence of varying environmental conditions related to soil, competition, and micro-climate, and (III) species-specific strategies to cope with prolonged environmental stress. To deepen our knowledge within this context, studying tree performance within larger networks seems a promising research avenue. Ideally such networks are already established during the actual period of environmental stress. One approach for identifying stressed forests suitable for such monitoring networks is to assess measures related to tree vitality in near real-time across large regions by means of satellite-borne remote sensing. Within this context, we introduce the European Forest Condition monitor (EFCM)---a remote-sensing based, freely available, interactive web information tool. The EFCM depicts forest greenness (as approximated using NDVI from MODIS at a spatial resolution of roughly 5.3 hectares) for the pixel-specific growing season across Europe and consequently allows for guiding research within the context of concurrent forest performance. To allow for inter-temporal comparability and account for pixel-specific features, all observations are set in relation to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) records over the monitoring period beginning in 2001. The EFCM provides both a quantile-based and a proportion-based product, thereby allowing for both relative and absolute comparison of forest greenness over the observational record. Based on six specific examples related to spring phenology, drought, late-frost, tree die-back on water-logged soils, an ice storm, and windthrow we exemplify how the EFCM may help identifying hotspots of extraordinary forest greenness. We discuss advantages and limitations when monitoring forest condition at large scales on the basis of moderate resolution remote sensing products to guide users toward an appropriate interpretation.},

However, it would require nearly doubling to achieve, costefficiently, coverage targets for all countries, ecoregions, important sites, and species. Poorer countries have the largest relative shortfalls. Such extensive and rapid expansion of formal PAs is unlikely to be achievable. Greater focus is therefore needed on alternative approaches, including community- and privately managed sites and other effective area-based conservation measures.},

The prevalence and extent to which carbon assimilation (source) or cambial activity (sink) mediate wood production are fundamentally important and remain elusive. We quantified source-sink relations across biomes by combining eddy-covariance gross primary production with extensive on-site and regional tree ring observations. We found widespread temporal decoupling between carbon assimilation and tree growth, underpinned by contrasting climatic sensitivities of these two processes. Substantial differences in assimilation-growth decoupling between angiosperms and gymnosperms were determined, as well as stronger decoupling with canopy closure, aridity, and decreasing temperatures. Our results reveal pervasive sink control over tree growth that is likely to be increasingly prominent under global climate change.},

  abstract = {Tree mortality is a key factor influencing forest functions and dynamics, but our understanding of the mechanisms leading to mortality and the associated changes in tree growth rates are still limited. We compiled a new pan-continental tree-ring width database from sites where both dead and living trees were sampled (2970 dead and 4224 living trees from 190 sites, including 36 species), and compared early and recent growth rates between trees that died and those that survived a given mortality event. We observed a decrease in radial growth before death in ca. 84\% of the mortality events. The extent and duration of these reductions were highly variable (1--100~years in 96\% of events) due to the complex interactions among study species and the source(s) of mortality. Strong and long-lasting declines were found for gymnosperms, shade- and drought-tolerant species, and trees that died from competition. Angiosperms and trees that died due to biotic attacks (especially bark-beetles) typically showed relatively small and short-term growth reductions. Our analysis did not highlight any universal trade-off between early growth and tree longevity within a species, although this result may also reflect high variability in sampling design among sites. The intersite and interspecific variability in growth patterns before mortality provides valuable information on the nature of the mortality process, which is consistent with our understanding of the physiological mechanisms leading to mortality. Abrupt changes in growth immediately before death can be associated with generalized hydraulic failure and/or bark-beetle attack, while long-term decrease in growth may be associated with a gradual decline in hydraulic performance coupled with depletion in carbon reserves. Our results imply that growth-based mortality algorithms may be a powerful tool for predicting gymnosperm mortality induced by chronic stress, but not necessarily so for angiosperms and in case of intense drought or bark-beetle outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Crop yield improvement during the last decades has relied on increasing the ratio of the economic organ to the total aboveground biomass, known as the harvest index (HI). In most crop models, HI is set as a parameter; this empirical approach does not consider that HI not only depends on plant genotype, but is also affected by the environment. An alternative is to simulate allocation mechanistically, as in the LPJ-GUESS crop model, which simulates HI based on daily growing conditions and the crop development stage. Simulated HI is critical for agricultural research due to its economic importance, but it also can validate the robust representation of production processes. However, there is a challenge to constrain parameter values globally for the allocation processes. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the sensitivity of yield and HI of wheat and maize simulated with LPJ-GUESS to eight production allocation-related parameters and identify the most suitable parameter values for global simulations. The nitrogen demand reduction after anthesis, the minimum leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) and the range of leaf C:N strongly affected carbon assimilation and yield, while the retranslocation of labile stem carbon to grains and the retranslocation rate of nitrogen and carbon from vegetative organs to grains after anthesis mainly influenced HI. A global database of observed HI for both crops was compiled for reference to constrain simulations before calibrating parameters for yield against reference data. Two high- and low-yielding maize cultivars emerged from the calibration, whilst spring and winter cultivars were found appropriate for wheat. The calibrated version of LPJ-GUESS improved the simulation of yield and HI at the global scale for both crops, providing a basis for future studies exploring crop production under different climate and management scenarios.},

It remains uncertain, however, to what extent biogeochemical processes can suppress global GPP growth3. As a consequence, modelling estimates of terrestrial carbon storage, and of feedbacks between the carbon cycle and climate, remain poorly constrained4. Here we present a global, measurement-based estimate of GPP growth during the twentieth century that is based on long-term atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS) records, derived from ice-core, firn and ambient air samples5. We interpret these records using a model that simulates changes in COS concentration according to changes in its sources and sinks-including a large sink that is related to GPP. We find that the observation-based COS record is most consistent with simulations of climate and the carbon cycle that assume large GPP growth during the twentieth century (31\% {\textpm} 5\% growth; mean {\textpm} 95\% confidence interval). Although this COS analysis does not directly constrain models of future GPP growth, it does provide a global-scale benchmark for historical carbon-cycle simulations.},

Three processes contribute to this rapid increase. Two of these processes concern emissions. Recent growth of the world economy combined with an increase in its carbon intensity have led to rapid growth in fossil fuel CO2 emissions since 2000: comparing the 1990s with 2000-2006, the emissions growth rate increased from 1.3\% to 3.3\% y-1. The third process is indicated by increasing evidence (P = 0.89) for a long-term (50-year) increase in the airborne fraction (AF) of CO2 emissions, implying a decline in the efficiency of CO2 sinks on land and oceans in absorbing anthropogenic emissions. Since 2000, the contributions of these three factors to the increase in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate have been {$\approx$}65 {\textpm} 16\% from increasing global economic activity, 17 {\textpm} 6\% from the increasing carbon intensity of the global economy, and 18 {\textpm} 15\% from the increase in AF. An increasing AF is consistent with results of climate-carbon cycle models, but the magnitude of the observed signal appears larger than that estimated by models.

  abstract = {The driver of leaf mortality during drought stress is a critical unknown. We used the commercially important tree Persea americana, in which there is a large variation in the degree of drought-induced leaf death across the canopy, to test whether embolism formation in the xylem during drought drives this leaf mortality. A large range in the number of embolized vessels in the petioles of leaves was observed across the canopy of plants that had experienced drought. Despite considerable variation between leaves, the amount of embolized vessels in the xylem of the petiole strongly correlated with area of drought-induced tissue death in individual leaves. Consistent with this finding was a large interleaf variability in xylem resistance to embolism, with a 1.45 MPa variation in the water potential at which 50\% of the xylem in the leaf midrib embolized across leaves. Our results implicate xylem embolism as a driver of leaf mortality during drought. Moreover, we propose that heterogeneity in drought-induced leaf mortality across a canopy is caused by high interleaf variability in xylem resistance to embolism, which may act as a buffer against complete canopy death during prolonged drought in P. americana.},

Black locust is able to reproduce via seeds, stump shoots, and root suckers. However, little research has been conducted on the reproduction and spreading of black locust in short rotation coppices. This research study focused on seed germination, stump shoot resprout, and spreading by root suckering of black locust in ten short rotation coppices in Germany. Seed experiments and sample plots were analyzed for the study. Spreading was detected and measured with unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based images and classification technology-object-based image analysis (OBIA). Additionally, the classification of single UAS images was tested by applying a convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep learning model. The analyses showed that seed germination increases with increasing warm-cold variety and scarification. Moreover, it was found that the number of shoots per stump decreases as shoot age increases. Furthermore, spreading increases with greater light availability and decreasing tillage. The OBIA and CNN image analysis technologies achieved 97\% and 99.5\% accuracy for black locust classification in UAS images. All in all, the three reproduction strategies of black locust in short rotation coppices differ with regards to initialization, intensity, and growth performance, but all play a role in the survival and spreading of black locust.},

Increasing advocacy for alternatives to conventional hard engineering solutions is accompanied by demands for evidence. This study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct evidence for the effect of tree cover on channel discharge. The results highlighted a deficiency in direct evidence. From 7 eligible studies of 156 papers reviewed, the results show that increasing tree cover has a small statistically significant effect on reducing channel discharge. Meta-analysis reveals that tree cover reduces channel discharge (standardised mean difference -0.35, 95\%CI, -0.71 to 0.00), but the effect was variable (I2 = 81.91\%), the potential for confounding was high, and publication bias is strongly suspected (Egger Test z = 3.0568, p =.002). Due to the lack of direct evidence the overall strength of evidence is low, indicating high uncertainty. Further primary research is required to understand reasons for heterogeneity and reduce uncertainty. A Bayesian network parameterised with data from the meta-analysis supports investment in integrated catchment management, particularly on infrastructure density and water storage (reservoirs), for effective responses to flood risk.},

  abstract = {European cities face a range of challenges over the coming decades that will influence the nature of urban growth and development across the continent. Climate change is central amongst these, and will have direct implications for urban processes through changes to temperature and precipitation patterns. As European cities contribute to and are supported by tightly coupled global networks of socio-economic and biophysical goods and services, many of which are influenced by weather and climate, a changing climate will present complex and uncertain indirect impacts for cities to contend with. Climate change adaptation relates to responding to the risks and potential opportunities associated with changing climates. Although adaptation appears at present to be a relatively low priority issue for city planners and governors in Europe, there are examples from policy and practice that demonstrate positive activity in this field. Although these initiatives do not always have adaptation as their primary focus, they do highlight progress in this arena and offer transferable lessons to other cities aiming to address the impacts of a changing climate. However, there remain a series of barriers to progress that relate to issues such as policy and governance frameworks, and more nebulous issues including complexity and uncertainty in climate science and institutional structures. These barriers must be acknowledged and addressed as a part of an approach that responds holistically to the adaptation challenge that faces European cities in the coming decades. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

These forests are important carbon sinks, and their conservation efforts are vital for the EU's vision of achieving climate neutrality by 20502. However, the increasing demand for forest services and products, driven by the bioeconomy, poses challenges for sustainable forest management. Here we use fine-scale satellite data to observe an increase in the harvested forest area (49 per cent) and an increase in biomass loss (69 per cent) over Europe for the period of 2016--2018 relative to 2011--2015, with large losses occurring on the Iberian Peninsula and in the Nordic and Baltic countries. Satellite imagery further reveals that the average patch size of harvested area increased by 34 per cent across Europe, with potential effects on biodiversity, soil erosion and water regulation. The increase in the rate of forest harvest is the result of the recent expansion of wood markets, as suggested by econometric indicators on forestry, wood-based bioenergy and international trade. If such a high rate of forest harvest continues, the post-2020 EU vision of forest-based climate mitigation may be hampered, and the additional carbon losses from forests would require extra emission reductions in other sectors in order to reach climate neutrality by 20503.},

However, while their effectiveness is well established for wet tropics, it is often argued that R\&A are less advantageous or even detrimental at higher latitudes, where the reduction of forest albedo (the amount of reflected solar radiation by a surface) tends to nullify or even overcome the carbon benefits. Here, we carefully analyze the situation for R\&A at midlatitudes, where the warming effects due to vegetation albedo are regarded to be almost balanced by the cooling effects from an increased carbon storage. Using both satellite data and atmospheric boundary-layer models, we show that by including cloud--albedo effects due to land--atmosphere interactions, the R\&A cooling at midlatitudes becomes prevalent. This points to a much greater potential of R\&A for wet temperate regions than previously considered.},

  abstract = {Surface albedo is a key parameter in the Earth's energy balance since it affects the amount of solar radiation directly absorbed at the planet surface. Its variability in time and space can be globally retrieved through the use of remote sensing products. To evaluate and improve the quality of satellite retrievals, careful intercomparisons with in situ measurements of surface albedo are crucial. For this purpose we compared MODIS albedo retrievals with surface measurements taken at 53 FLUXNET sites that met strict conditions of land cover homogeneity. A good agreement between mean yearly values of satellite retrievals and in situ measurements was found (r 2=0.82). The mismatch is correlated with the spatial heterogeneity of surface albedo, stressing the relevance of land cover homogeneity when comparing point to pixel data. When the seasonal patterns of MODIS albedo are considered for different plant functional types, the match with surface observations is extremely good at all forest sites. On the contrary, satellite retrievals at non-forested sites (grasslands, savannas, croplands) underestimate in situ measurements across the seasonal cycle. The mismatch observed at grassland and cropland sites is likely due to the extreme fragmentation of these landscapes, as confirmed by geostatistical attributes derived from high resolution scenes. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Such studies are notoriously deficient at predicting the rainfall in the Amazon basin and how the vegetation interacts with the rainfall is poorly represented. Here, we use long-term surface-based observations of the air temperature and rainfall in Amazonia to provide a constraint on the modelled sensitivity of temperature to changes in precipitation. This emergent constraint also allows us to significantly constrain the likelihood of a forest collapse or dieback. We conclude that Amazon dieback under IPCC scenario RCP8.5 (crossing the tipping point) is not likely to occur in the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {Regrowth of tropical secondary forests following complete or nearly complete removal of forest vegetation actively stores carbon in aboveground biomass, partially counterbalancing carbon emissions from deforestation, forest degradation, burning of fossil fuels, and other anthropogenic sources. We estimate the age and spatial extent of lowland second-growth forests in the Latin American tropics and model their potential aboveground carbon accumulation over four decades. Our model shows that, in 2008, second-growth forests (1 to 60 years old) covered 2.4 million km2 of land (28.1\%of the total study area).Over 40 years, these lands can potentially accumulate a total aboveground carbon stock of 8.48 Pg C (petagrams of carbon) in aboveground biomass via low-cost natural regeneration or assisted regeneration, corresponding to a total CO2 sequestration of 31.09 Pg CO2. This total is equivalent to carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and industrial processes in all of Latin America and the Caribbean from1993 to 2014. Ten countries account for 95\% of this carbon storage potential, led by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. We model future land-use scenarios to guide national carbon mitigation policies. Permitting natural regeneration on 40\% of lowland pastures potentially stores an additional 2.0 Pg C over 40 years. Our study provides information and maps to guide national-level forest-based carbon mitigation plans on the basis of estimated rates of natural regeneration and pasture abandonment. Coupled with avoided deforestation and sustainable forestmanagement, natural regeneration of second-growth forests provides a low-costmechanism that yields a high carbon sequestration potential with multiple benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

Three main sub-canopy tree species in this region were examined. After rainfall reduction, Lindera obtusiloba showed severe dieback, but two other co-occurring species did not show dieback. The water potential at stomatal closure of Dendrobenthamia japonica, L. obtusiloba and Sorbus alnifolia was -1.70, -2.54 and -3.41 MPa, respectively, whereas the water potential at 88 \% loss in hydraulic conductivity of the three species was -2.31, -2.11 and -7.01 MPa, respectively. Taken together, near-anisohydric L. obtusiloba with vulnerable xylem was highly susceptible to drought dieback. Anisohydric S. alnifolia had the most negative minimum water potential, and its xylem was the most resistant to cavitation. Isohydric D. japonica conserved water by rapidly closing its stomata. Ultimately, the hydraulic safety margin (HSM) of L. obtusiloba was the smallest among the three species, especially in precipitation-reduced plots. In terms of the stomatal safety margin (SSM), L. obtusiloba was negative, while S. alnifolia and D. japonica were positive. Of the two species without dieback, rainfall reduction decreased growth of D. japonica, but did not influence growth of S. Alnifolia; meanwhile, rainfall reduction led to a decrease of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in D. japonica, but an increase in S. alnifolia. It is concluded that HSM as well as SSM allow interpreting the sensitivity of the three sub-canopy species to drought. The drought-induced dieback of L. obtusiloba is determined by the interaction of stomatal behaviour and xylem vulnerability, and the species could be sensitive to climate change-caused drought although still in sub-humid areas. The isohydric/anisohydric degree is associated with NSCs status and growth of plants.},

Using this framework, we provide robust observationally inferred evidence that a strong CO 2 fertilization effect is detectable in globally distributed eddy covariance networks. Applying our method to upscale photosynthesis globally, we find that the magnitude of the CO 2 fertilization effect is comparable to its in situ counterpart but highlight the potential for substantial underestimation of this effect in tropical forests for many reflectance-based satellite photosynthesis products.},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from biomass combustion are traditionally assumed climate neutral if the bioenergy system is carbon (C) flux neutral, i.e. the CO2 released from biofuel combustion approximately equals the amount of CO2 sequestered in biomass. This convention, widely adopted in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of bioenergy systems, underestimates the climate impact of bioenergy. Besides CO2 emissions from permanent C losses, CO2 emissions from C flux neutral systems (that is from temporary C losses) also contribute to climate change: before being captured by biomass regrowth, CO2 molecules spend time in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. In this paper, a method to estimate the climate impact of CO2 emissions from biomass combustion is proposed. Our method uses CO2 impulse response functions (IRF) from C cycle models in the elaboration of atmospheric decay functions for biomass-derived CO2 emissions. Their contributions to global warming are then quantified with a unit-based index, the GWPbio. Since this index is expressed as a function of the rotation period of the biomass, our results can be applied to CO2 emissions from combustion of all the different biomass species, from annual row crops to slower growing boreal forest. {\copyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {It is difficult to accurately estimate species richness if there are many almost undetectable species in a hyper-diverse community. Practically, an accurate lower bound for species richness is preferable to an inaccurate point estimator. The traditional nonparametric lower bound developed by Chao (1984, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 11, 265-270) for individual-based abundance data uses only the information on the rarest species (the numbers of singletons and doubletons) to estimate the number of undetected species in samples. Applying a modified Good-Turing frequency formula, we derive an approximate formula for the first-order bias of this traditional lower bound. The approximate bias is estimated by using additional information (namely, the numbers of tripletons and quadrupletons). This approximate bias can be corrected, and an improved lower bound is thus obtained. The proposed lower bound is nonparametric in the sense that it is universally valid for any species abundance distribution. A similar type of improved lower bound can be derived for incidence data. We test our proposed lower bounds on simulated data sets generated from various species abundance models. Simulation results show that the proposed lower bounds always reduce bias over the traditional lower bounds and improve accuracy (as measured by mean squared error) when the heterogeneity of species abundances is relatively high. We also apply the proposed new lower bounds to real data for illustration and for comparisons with previously developed estimators.},

Previous studies suggested that canopy structure parameters influence both {$\alpha$} and z 0; however, no field data have been reported to quantify their relationships. Here, we hypothesize that a functional relationship between {$\alpha$} and z 0 exists for a vegetated surface, since both land surface parameters can be conceptually related to the characteristics of canopy structure. We test this hypothesis by using the observed data collected from 50 site-years of field measurements from sites worldwide covering various vegetated surfaces. On the basis of these data, a negative linear relationship between {$\alpha$} and log(z 0) was found, which is related to the canopy structural parameter. We believe that our finding is a big step toward the estimation of z 0 with high accuracy. This can be used, for example, in the parameterization of land properties and the observation of z 0 using satellite remote sensing. {\copyright} 2011 ISB.},

  abstract = {Shifts in rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures associated with climate change are likely to cause widespread forest decline in regions where droughts are predicted to increase in duration and severity. One primary cause of productivity loss and plant mortality during drought is hydraulic failure. Drought stress creates trapped gas emboli in the water transport system, which reduces the ability of plants to supply water to leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange and can ultimately result in desiccation and mortality. At present we lack a clear picture of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad range of species and environments, despite many individual experiments. Here we draw together published and unpublished data on the vulnerability of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for a large number of woody species, with a view to examining the likely consequences of climate change for forest biomes. We show that 70\% of 226 forest species from 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow ({$<$}1a megapascal) hydraulic safety margins against injurious levels of drought stress and therefore potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature and aridity increase as predicted for many regions across the globe. Safety margins are largely independent of mean annual precipitation, showing that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of forests to drought, with all forest biomes equally vulnerable to hydraulic failure regardless of their current rainfall environment. These findings provide insight into why drought-induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests not normally considered at drought risk. {\copyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The NDVI-derived vegetation growth patterns show very strong seasonal cycles and interannual variations. The growing season length varies between years. The correlation between NDVI and precipitation (r = 0.75, P {$<$} 0.01) in Lhasa area is higher than the correlation between NDVI and temperature (r = 0.63, P {$<$} 0.01), suggesting that NDVI is more sensitive to precipitation than temperature in this semiarid climate zone. Furthermore, the time series of NDVI demonstrate a positive trend from 1985 to 1999, which means that the vegetation biomass present on land surface is increasing. This trend is strongly correlated to increased rainfall and temperature from mid-1980s to 1990s in the Lhasa area of the Tibetan Plateau. {\copyright} 2007 Regents of the University of Colorado.},

But although severe regional heatwaves may become more frequent in a changing climate, their impact on terrestrial carbon cycling is unclear. Here we report measurements of ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes, remotely sensed radiation absorbed by plants, and country-level crop yields taken during the European heatwave in 2003. We use a terrestrial biosphere simulation model to assess continental-scale changes in primary productivity during 2003, and their consequences for the net carbon balance. We estimate a 30 per cent reduction in gross primary productivity over Europe, which resulted in a strong anomalous net source of carbon dioxide (0.5 Pg C yr-1) to the atmosphere and reversed the effect of four years of net ecosystem carbon sequestration. Our results suggest that productivity reduction in eastern and western Europe can be explained by rainfall deficit and extreme summer heat, respectively. We also find that ecosystem respiration decreased together with gross primary productivity, rather than accelerating with the temperature rise. Model results, corroborated by historical records of crop yields, suggest that such a reduction in Europe's primary productivity is unprecedented during the last century. An increase in future drought events could turn temperate ecosystems into carbon sources, contributing to positive carbon-climate feedbacks already anticipated in the tropics and at high latitudes. {\copyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

Failure to capture disturbance dynamics and feedbacks limits the utility of ESMs for predictive understanding and application to societally important problems. This workshop considered (a) dynamic processes that significantly affect terrestrial ecosystems and the coupled Earth system and (b) the data constraints and modeling challenges important for future progress. There were three dominant workshop conclusions: vegetation changes, including disturbance- driven changes, are affecting climate and natural resources; these impacts are expected to increase in the future; and, yet, current models have insufficient data and process representations to adequately predict these changes.},

Here, the performance of this concept is explored beyond this limit of validity. This is accomplished by analysing a three-dimensional meso-scale simulation of land-sea breeze systems which originate at large-scale temperature differences between water and land surfaces and by employing a one-dimensional version of the meso-scale model as a vertical column of a hypothesized macro-scale model. It appears that areally averaged surface fluxes can be reproduced reasonably well. This is valid for area-averaged fluxes obtained by the average of surface fluxes on each land type, i.e. for so-called flux aggregation, and for a combination of flux aggregation and so-called parameter aggregation where similar land types are combined into an aggregated land surface. The weak dependence of averaged surface fluxes on secondary, meso-scale motions agrees with earlier theoretical considerations. {\copyright} 1995.},

  abstract = {Climate adaptation actions can be energy-intensive, but how adaptation feeds back into the energy system and the environment is absent in nearly all up-to-date energy scenarios. Here we quantify the impacts of adaptation actions entailing direct changes in final energy use on energy investments and costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution. We find that energy needs for adaptation increase considerably over time and with warming. The resulting addition in capacity for power generation leads to higher greenhouse gas emissions, local air pollutants, and energy system costs. In the short to medium term, much of the added capacity for power generation is fossil-fuel based. We show that mitigation pathways accounting for the adaptation-energy feedback would require a higher global carbon price, between 5\% and 30\% higher. Because of the benefits in terms of reduced adaptation needs, energy system costs in ambitious mitigation scenarios would be lower than previous estimates, and they would turn negative in well-below-2-degree scenarios, pointing at net gains in terms of power system costs.},

  abstract = {Forests are likely to show complex transient responses to rapid changes in climate. The model described here simulates the dynamics of forest landscapes in a changing environment with simple phenomenological equations for tree growth processes and local environmental feedbacks. Tree establishment and growth rates are modified by species-specific functions describing the effects of winter and summer temperature limitations, accumulated annual foliage net assimilation and sapwood respiration as functions of temperature, CO2 fertilization, and growing-season drought. These functions provide external conditions for the simulation of patch-scale forest dynamics by a forest succession model, FORSKA, in which all of the trees on each 0.1 ha patch interact by competition for light and nutrients. The landscape is simulated as an array of such patches. The probability of disturbance on a patch is a power function of time since disturbance. Forest structure, composition and biomass simulated for the landscape average in boreal and temperate deciduous forests approach reasonable equilibrium values in 200-400 years. A climatic warning scenario is applied to central Sweden, where temperature and precipitation increases are shown to interact with each other and with soil water capacity in determining the transient and equilibrium responses of the forest landscape to climate change. {\copyright} 1993.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a system of models for the simulation of gas and energy exchange of a leaf of a C3 plant in free air. The physiological processes are simulated by sub-models that: (a) give net photosynthesis (An) as a function of environmental and leaf parameters and stomatal conductance (gs); (b) give g, as a function of the concentration of CO2 and H2O in air at the leaf surface and the current rate of photosynthesis of the leaf. An energy balance and mass transport sub-model is used to couple the physiological processes through a variable boundary layer to the ambient environment. The models are based on theoretical and empirical analysis of gs, and An measured at the leaf level, and tests with intact attached leaves of soybeans show very good agreement between predicted and measured responses of gs and An over a wide range of leaf temperatures (20-35{$^\circ$}C), CO2 concentrations (10-90 Pa), air to leaf water vapor deficits (0.5-3.7 kPa) and light intensities (100-2000 {$\mu$}mol m-2s-1). The combined models were used to simulate the responses of latent heat flux ({$\lambda$}E) and gs for a soybean canopy for the course of an idealized summer day, using the 'big-leaf' approximation. Appropriate data are not yet available to provide a rigorous test of these simulations, but the response patterns are similar to field observations. These simulations show a pronounced midday depression of {$\lambda$}E and gs at low or high values of boundary-layer conductance. Deterioration of plant water relations during midday has often been invoked to explain this common natural phenomenon, but the present models do not consider this possibility. Analysis of the model indicates that the simulated midday depression is, in part, the result of positive feedback mediated by the boundary layer. For example, a change in gs affects An and {$\lambda$}E. As a consequence, the temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration of the air in the proximity of the stomata (e.g. the air at the leaf surface) change and these, in turn, affect gs. The simulations illustrate the possible significance of the boundary layer in mediating feedback loops which affect the regulation of stomatal conductance and {$\lambda$}E. The simulations also examine the significance of changing the response properties of the photosynthetic component of the model by changing leaf protein content or the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere. {\copyright} 1991.},

Several new terms for climate change-induced distress have been introduced to describe the long-term emotional consequences of anticipated or actual environmental changes, with ecological grief as a prime example. The mourning of the loss of ecosystems, landscapes, species and ways of life is likely to become a more frequent experience around the world. However, there is a lack of conceptual clarity and systematic research efforts with regard to such ecological grief. This perspective article introduces the concept of ecological grief and contextualizes it within the field of bereavement. We provide a case description of a mountaineer in Central Europe dealing with ecological grief. We introduce ways by which ecological grief may pose a mental health risk and/or motivate environmental behavior and delineate aspects by which it can be differentiated from related concepts of solastalgia and eco-anxiety. In conclusion, we offer a systematic agenda for future research that is embedded in the context of disaster mental health and bereavement research.},

  abstract = {To constrain global warming, we must strongly curtail greenhouse gas emissions and capture excess atmospheric carbon dioxide1,2. Regrowing natural forests is a prominent strategy for capturing additional carbon3, but accurate assessments of its potential are limited by uncertainty and variability in carbon accumulation rates2,3. To assess why and where rates differ, here we compile 13,112 georeferenced measurements of carbon accumulation. Climatic factors explain variation in rates better than land-use history, so we combine the field measurements with 66 environmental covariate layers to create a global, one-kilometre-resolution map of potential aboveground carbon accumulation rates for the first 30 years of natural forest regrowth. This map shows over 100-fold variation in rates across the globe, and indicates that default rates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)4,5 may~underestimate aboveground carbon accumulation rates by 32 per cent on average and do not capture eight-fold variation within ecozones. Conversely, we conclude that maximum climate mitigation potential from natural forest regrowth is 11 per cent lower than previously reported3 owing to the use of overly high rates for the location of potential new forest. Although our data compilation includes more studies and sites than previous efforts, our results depend on data availability, which is concentrated in ten countries, and data quality, which varies across studies. However, the plots cover most of the environmental conditions across the areas for which we predicted carbon accumulation rates (except for northern Africa and northeast Asia). We therefore provide a robust and globally consistent tool for assessing natural forest regrowth as a climate mitigation strategy.},

Although some species are moving already, their ability to keep up with the faster changes expected in the future is unclear. 'Migration lag' is a particular concern with plants, because it could threaten both biodiversity and carbon storage. Plant movements are not realistically represented in models currently used to predict future vegetation and carbon-cycle feedbacks, so there is an urgent need to understand how much of a problem failure to track climate change is likely to be. Therefore, in this review, we compare how fast plants need to move with how fast they can move; that is, the velocity of climate change with the velocity of plant movement. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Combustion power plants emit carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a major contributor to climate change. Direct emissions measurement is cost-prohibitive globally, while reporting varies in detail, latency, and granularity. To fill this gap and greatly increase the number of power plants worldwide with independent emissions monitoring, we developed and applied machine learning (ML) models using power plant water vapor plumes as proxy signals to estimate electric power generation and CO2 emissions using Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope imagery. Our ML models estimated power plant activity on each image snapshot, then an aggregation model predicted plant utilization over a 30-day period. Lastly, emission factors specific to region, fuel, and plant technology were used to convert the estimated electricity generation into CO2 emissions. Models were trained with reported hourly electricity generation data in the US, Europe, and Australia and were validated with additional generation and emissions data from the US, Europe, Australia, T{\"u}rkiye, and India. All results with sufficiently large sample sizes indicate that our models outperformed the baseline approaches. In validating our model results against available generation and emissions reported data, we calculated the root mean square error as 1.75 TWh (236 plants across 17 countries over 4 years) and 2.18 Mt CO2 (207 plants across 17 countries over 4 years), respectively. Ultimately, we applied our ML method to plants that constitute 32\% of global power plant CO2 emissions, as estimated by Climate TRACE, averaged over the period 2015--2022. This dataset is the most comprehensive independent and free-of-cost global power plant point-source emissions monitoring system currently known to the authors and is made freely available to the public to support global emissions reduction.},

Analyses of model-simulated soil moisture, drought indices and precipitation-minus- evaporation suggest increased risk of drought in the twenty-first century. There are, however, large differences in the observed and model-simulated drying patterns. Reconciling these differences is necessary before the model predictions can be trusted. Previous studies show that changes in sea surface temperatures have large influences on land precipitation and the inability of the coupled models to reproduce many observed regional precipitation changes is linked to the lack of the observed, largely natural change patterns in sea surface temperatures in coupled model simulations. Here I show that the models reproduce not only the influence of El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation on drought over land, but also the observed global mean aridity trend from 1923 to 2010. Regional differences in observed and model-simulated aridity changes result mainly from natural variations in tropical sea surface temperatures that are often not captured by the coupled models. The unforced natural variations vary among model runs owing to different initial conditions and thus are irreproducible. I conclude that the observed global aridity changes up to 2010 are consistent with model predictions, which suggest severe and widespread droughts in the next 30-90 years over many land areas resulting from either decreased precipitation and/or increased evaporation. {\copyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called 'early warning signals', and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data. {\copyright} 2012 Dakos et al.},

  abstract = {Developing management strategies for addressing global climate change has become an increasingly important issue influencing forest management around the globe. Currently, management approaches are being proposed that intend to (1) mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon stores and (2) foster adaptation by maintaining compositionally and structurally complex forests. However, little is known about the compatibility of these two objectives or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, we examined stand-level carbon and complexity responses using five long-term ({$>$}50. yrs) silviculture experiments within the upper Great Lakes region, USA. In particular, live tree carbon stores and sequestration rates, and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiments in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiments in northern hardwood systems to elucidate the long-term effects of management on these ecosystem attributes and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objectives.As expected, we observed a general increase in large tree densities with stand age and positive relationships between stand stocking level and live tree carbon stores. More importantly, our results clearly identify tradeoffs between the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives across each study. For example, maintaining higher stocking levels (i.e., enhanced mitigation by increasing carbon stores) resulted in decreases in stand-level structural and compositional complexity (i.e., reduced adaptation potential). In addition, rates of live tree carbon increment were also the lowest within the highest stocking levels; despite the benefits of these stand conditions to maximizing carbon stores. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of avoiding rigid adherence to a single objective, such as maximum on-site carbon stores, without recognizing potential consequences to other ecosystem components crucial to ensuring long-term ecosystem functioning within the context of environmental change. One potential stand-level strategy for balancing these goals may be to employ multi-aged management systems, such as irregular shelterwood and selection systems, that maintain a large proportion of carbon stores in retained mature trees while using thinning to create spatial heterogeneity that promotes higher sequestration rates in smaller, younger trees and simultaneously enhances structural and compositional complexity. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

However, it is difficult to forecast phenology for a given species, due to a lack of knowledge about chilling requirements. We quantified chilling and heat requirements for leaf unfolding in two European tree species and investigated their relative contributions to phenological variations between and within populations. We used an extensive database containing information about the leaf phenology of 14 oak and 10 beech populations monitored over elevation gradients since 2005. In parallel, we studied the various bud dormancy phases, in controlled conditions, by regularly sampling low- and high-elevation populations during fall and winter. Oak was 2.3 times more sensitive to temperature for leaf unfolding over the elevation gradient and had a lower chilling requirement for dormancy release than beech. We found that chilling is currently insufficient for the full release of dormancy, for both species, at the lowest elevations in the area studied. Genetic variation in leaf unfolding timing between and within oak populations was probably due to differences in heat requirement rather than differences in chilling requirement. Our results demonstrate the importance of chilling for leaf unfolding in forest trees and indicate that the advance in leaf unfolding phenology with increasing temperature will probably be less pronounced than forecasted. This highlights the urgent need to determine experimentally the interactions between chilling and heat requirements in forest tree species, to improve our understanding and modeling of changes in phenological timing under global warming.},

Forests have traditionally been viewed as robust carbon (C) sinks; however, extreme heat-waves, drought and wildfire have increased tree mortality, particularly in widespread semi-arid regions, which account for {$\sim$}41\% of Earth's land surface. Using a set of modeling experiments, we show that California grasslands are a more resilient C sink than forests in response to 21st century changes in climate, with implications for designing climate-smart Cap and Trade offset policies. The resilience of grasslands to rising temperatures, drought and fire, coupled with the preferential banking of C to belowground sinks, helps to preserve sequestered terrestrial C and prevent it from re-entering the atmosphere. In contrast, California forests appear unable to cope with unmitigated global changes in the climate, switching from substantial C sinks to C sources by at least the mid-21st century. These results highlight the inherent risk of relying on forest C offsets in the absence of management interventions to avoid substantial fire-driven C emissions. On the other hand, since grassland environments, including tree-sparse rangelands, appear more capable of maintaining C sinks in 21st century, such ecosystems should be considered as an alternative C offset to climate-vulnerable forests. The further development of climate-smart approaches in California's carbon marketplace could serve as an example to offset programs around the world, particularly those expanding into widespread arid and semi-arid regions.},

Accepted site-based management practices include leaving fallen dead and decaying wood in situ, providing supplementary coarse woody material (CWM), inducing decay in mature trees and strategic planting in order to maintain a balanced age structure of trees in both space and time. Here we examine the empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of such interventions using rigorous systematic review methodology. Systematic searching yielded 27 studies containing pertinent information. The evidence presently available is insufficient to critically appraise the utility of any specific intervention for conserving saproxylic species, or assemblages, in the long-term. However, there are a range of studies, conducted over relatively short periods of time, which do describe changes in saproxylic fauna in response to management practices. In the absence of robust, high quality evidence, recommendations relating to the use of specific site-based conservation interventions should only be regarded as speculative. Nonetheless, general proposals for the maintenance of suitable microhabitats, such as the protection of veteran trees within the landscape, are based on sound ecological principles and should be encouraged even though experimentally controlled and replicated evidence is lacking. Further primary research and long-term monitoring are required to fill the gaps in our ecological knowledge that potentially weaken the case for the effectiveness of current saproxylic invertebrate conservation action and would enable practitioners to make better informed decisions with regard to dead wood protection and provision. {\copyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {A fully coupled land-ocean-atmosphere GCM is used to explore the biogeophysical impact of large-scale deforestation on surface climate. By analyzing the model sensitivity to global-scale replacement of forests by grassland, it is shown that the surface albedo increase owing to deforestation has a cooling effect of -1.36 K globally. On the other hand, forest removal decreases evapotranspiration efficiency and decreases surface roughness, both leading to a global surface warming of 0.24 and 0.29 K, respectively. The net biogeophysical impact of deforestation results from the competition between these effects. Globally, the albedo effect is dominant because of its wider-scale impact, and the net biogeophysical impact of deforestation is thus a cooling of -1 K. Over land, the balance between the different processes varies with latitude. In temperate and boreal zones of the Northern Hemisphere the albedo effect is stronger and deforestation thus induces a cooling. Conversely, in the tropics the net impact of deforestation is a warming, because evapotranspiration efficiency and surface roughness provide the dominant influence. The authors also explore the importance of the ocean coupling in shaping the climate response to deforestation. First, the temperature over ocean responds to the land cover perturbation. Second, even the temperature change over land is greatly affected by the ocean coupling. By assuming fixed oceanic conditions, the net effect of deforestation, averaged over all land areas, is a warming, whereas taking into account the coupling with the ocean leads, on the contrary, to a net land cooling. Furthermore, it is shown that the main parameter involved in the coupling with the ocean is surface albedo. Indeed, a change in albedo modifies temperature and humidity in the whole troposphere, thus enabling the initially land-confined perturbation to be transferred to the ocean. Finally, the radiative forcing framework is discussed in the context of land cover change impact on climate. The experiments herein illustrate that deforestation triggers two opposite types of forcingmechanisms-radiative forcing (owing to surface albedo change) and nonradiative forcing (owing to change in evapotranspiration efficiency and surface roughness)-that exhibit a similar magnitude globally. However, when applying the radiative forcing concept, nonradiative processes are ignored, which may lead to a misrepresentation of land cover change impact on climate. {\copyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

Across the more than 2 {\texttimes} 106 km2 of deserts and semideserts in the selected Central Asian ecoregions, a significant upward trend in NDVI is evident during the tenure of NOAA-11 (1989-1994). This trend is not found during any other period. We argue that the data from the PAL NDVI dataset for NOAA-11 will pose problems for land surface change analyses, if these significant sensor-related artifacts are ignored. We do not find these artifacts in data from the other three satellites (NOAA-7, NOAA-9, and NOAA-14). We suggest that the comparison of data from any combination of these three AVHRRs can be used for land surface change analyses, but that the inclusion of NOAA-11 AVHRR NDVI data in trend analyses may result in the detection of spurious trends.},

  abstract = {Forest microclimates contrast strongly with the climate outside forests. To fully understand and better predict how forests' biodiversity and functions relate to climate and climate change, microclimates need to be integrated into ecological research. Despite the potentially broad impact of microclimates on the response of forest ecosystems to global change, our understanding of how microclimates within and below tree canopies modulate biotic responses to global change at the species, community and ecosystem level is still limited. Here, we review how spatial and temporal variation in forest microclimates result from an interplay of forest features, local water balance, topography and landscape composition. We first stress and exemplify the importance of considering forest microclimates to understand variation in biodiversity and ecosystem functions across forest landscapes. Next, we explain how macroclimate warming (of the free atmosphere) can affect microclimates, and vice versa, via interactions with land-use changes across different biomes. Finally, we perform a priority ranking of future research avenues at the interface of microclimate ecology and global change biology, with a specific focus on three key themes: (1) disentangling the abiotic and biotic drivers and feedbacks of forest microclimates; (2) global and regional mapping and predictions of forest microclimates; and (3) the impacts of microclimate on forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the face of climate change. The availability of microclimatic data will significantly increase in the coming decades, characterizing climate variability at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales relevant to biological processes in forests. This will revolutionize our understanding of the dynamics, drivers and implications of forest microclimates on biodiversity and ecological functions, and the impacts of global changes. In order to support the sustainable use of forests and to secure their biodiversity and ecosystem services for future generations, microclimates cannot be ignored.},

  abstract = {This study uses a global terrestrial carbon cycle model (the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model), a satellite-derived map of existing vegetation, and global maps of natural vegetation to estimate the effects of human-induced land cover change on carbon emissions to the atmosphere and net primary production. We derived two maps approximating global land cover that would exist for current climate in the absence of human disturbance of the landscape, using a procedure that minimizes disagreements between maps of existing and natural vegetation that represent artifacts in the data. Similarly, we simulated monthly fields of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, required as input to CASA, for the undisturbed land cover case. Model results estimate total carbon losses from human-induced land cover changes of 182 and 199 Pg for the two simulations, compared with an estimate of 124 Pg for total flux between 1850 and 1990 [Houghton, 1999], suggesting that land cover change prior to 1850 accounted for approximately one-third of total carbon emissions from land use change. Estimates of global carbon loss from the two independence methods, the modeling approach used in this paper and the accounting approach of Houghton [1999], are comparable taking into account carbon losses from agricultural expansion prior to 1850 estimated at 48-57 Pg. However, estimates of regional carbon losses vary considerably, notably in temperate midlatitudes where our estimates indicate higher cumulative carbon loss. Overall, land cover changes reduced global annual net primary productivity (NPP) by approximately 5\%, with large regional variations. High-input agriculture in North America and Europe display higher annual NPP than the natural vegetation that would exist in the absence of cropland. However, NPP has been depleted in localized areas in South Asia and Africa by up to 90\%. These results provide initial crude estimates, limited by the spatial resolution of the data sets used as input to the model and by the lack of information about transient changes in land cover. The results suggest that a modeling approach can be used to estimate spatially-explicit effects of land cover change on biosphere-atmosphere interactions.},

  abstract = {Natural disturbances are fundamental to forest ecosystem dynamics and have been used for two decades to improve forest management, notably in the boreal forest. Initially based on fire regimes, there is now a need to extend the concept to include other types of disturbances as they can greatly contribute to forest dynamics in some regions of the boreal zone. Here we review the main descriptors-that is, the severity, specificity, spatial and temporal descriptors and legacies, of windthrow and spruce bud worm outbreak disturbance regimes in boreal forests-in order to facilitate incorporating them into a natural disturbance-based forest management framework. We also describe the biological legacies that are generated by these disturbances. Temporal and spatial descriptors characterising both disturbance types are generally variable in time and space. This makes them difficult to reproduce in an ecosystem management framework. However, severity and specificity descriptors may provide a template upon which policies for maintaining post harvesting and salvage logging biological legacies can be based. In a context in which management mainly targets mature and old-growth stages, integrating insect and wind disturbances in a management framework is an important goal, as these disturbances contribute to creating heterogeneity in mature and old-growth forest characteristics.},

  abstract = {Historical management practices could have a strong effect on the current status of forests and therefore affect the potential for outbreaks of forest pests. We tested whether forest management history and forest tending of Norway spruce affects the potential for bark beetle outbreaks after large disturbances. We also assessed the effect of the proportion of spruce under epidemic situations and different altitudes. For this survey we used long-term data on sanitary felling and forest inventory data. Forest management history was defined by the change in the forest compared to the natural forest composition and was divided into four classes of change in tree species composition. We compared the proportion of spruce and sanitary felling because of bark beetles with the different classes of change in tree species composition. Forest tending was analyzed by looking at how the proportion of realized cut in relation to the planned cut affected sanitary felling. The analysis was done with Bayesian modeling including both spatial autocorrelation and random effects. There was a strong association between the change in the forest tree species composition and the proportion of Norway spruce and sanitary felling because of spruce bark beetles. Interactions were observed between epidemic periods, the proportion of Norway spruce and altitude. Altitude had a negative influence and the proportion of Norway spruce had a positive influence on sanitary felling. During epidemic periods, sanitary felling was amplified at lower altitudes and in areas with a higher proportion of Norway spruce. Furthermore, there was a negative association between the proportion of realized cut in relation to the planned cut and sanitary felling in periods after abiotic stress. It is therefore suggested that monocultures of Norway spruce should be converted to mixed forests and that maintenance of the forest should be improved to increase resistance to bark beetle outbreaks.},

  abstract = {As the climate continues to change, species are moving to track their climatic niches. Although we are gaining a clearer picture of where and how quickly species ranges are moving, a mechanistic understanding of these changes is still nascent. Evolutionary changes in ranges and range-limiting traits over contemporary time-scales have received relatively little attention, possibly due to the mismatch in scale between rapid contemporary range shifts and the historical evolution of species ranges over millions of years. But recent experimental work has shown that range-limiting traits can evolve rapidly over decadal time-scales, effectively putting evolution back on the table towards the goal of a mechanistic understanding of contemporary range shifts. Here, I review the role of evolution in shaping range shift responses to recent climate change from the perspective of the past (shared evolutionary history, or phylogenetic signal in range shifts and range-limiting traits), present (variation in range-limiting traits) and future (incorporating evolution of range-limiting traits into range forecasts from species distribution models). In each of these areas, I found a critical role for evolution in understanding historical constraints and future changes in species ranges over contemporary time-scales: shared evolutionary history may constrain range shift responses for some taxa; compensatory mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity and adaptive evolution can modulate the range shift response; and incorporating evolution into species distribution models can qualitatively alter forecasts of future range shifts. Yet, more can be done in this context, and so I conclude by outlining near- and long-term goals for improving our understanding of the role of evolution in shaping species ranges in a rapidly changing world. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

  abstract = {Sustainable forest management has been approached on many occasions by defining and subsequently measuring a set of initially accepted indicators. This methodology permits the aggregation of multiple goods and services with heterogeneous characteristics into forest management. However, the calculation of these indicators has usually been static. When we find ourselves in situations in which there is a need to make long-term evaluations of the effects of possible scenarios affecting forest management, a procedure has to be set up to define and aggregate the different indicators over time, as well as to integrate the preferences of the stakeholders involved in management. This study shows a goal programming-based methodology, which permits to select the best management alternative in 6 climate change scenarios when different indicators are aggregated over 100 years in a mountain forest in Central Spain. The results revealed the predominance of one management alternative (no management) when the preferences of the stakeholders were aggregated. However, when the preferential weights corresponding to some stakeholders were included separately, the solution may notably vary, especially in the case of forest owners. It was concluded that the methodology proposed allows a dynamic aggregation of diverse sustainable forest management in addition to presenting a great flexibility at the moment of selecting various solutions proposed by the goal programming model, and the preferences of the different stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Two foundational questions about sustainability are ``How are ecosystems and the services they provide going to change in the future?'' and ``How do human decisions affect these trajectories?'' Answering these questions requires an ability to forecast ecological processes. Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term (daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data, one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade, data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure. Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training, culture, and institutions. The need to start forecasting is now; the time for making ecology more predictive is here, and learning by doing is the fastest route to drive the science forward.},

Energy density is defined here as the annual energy production per hectare, taking energy inputs into account. Using 5 scenarios, consisting of 1 set focusing on technical differences and 1 set focusing on geographical variations, the range of energy densities currently obtained in Europe was determined for the following fuels: biodiesel from rapeseed; bioethanol from sugar beet; electricity from wood, wind and solar PV. The energy densities of the fuels produced from biomass were calculated by determining the energy contained in the energy carrier produced from the crop annually produced on 1 ha, from which the energy inputs for crop cultivation and conversion were subtracted. For wind and solar electricity, the energy density calculation was based on the energy production per turbine or cell and the number of turbines or cells per hectare after which the manufacturing energy was subtracted. Comparing the results shows that, for the average energy density scenarios, the ratio between the energy densities for wind, solar, and biomass is approximately 100:42:1, with wind electricity also having the highest energy output/input ratio. A case study was done in which the energy density was used to calculate the distance a vehicle can cover using the energy carrier annually produced per hectare. This was done for 3 regions, in Mid-Sweden, North-Netherlands, and South-East Spain. The results of the case show that wind electricity results in the largest distance covered, except in Spain, where solar electricity is the most favourable option. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

For the very first time, this study reports on aboveground biomass yield and energy balance of a 16-year-old poplar SRC with a mixture of 17 pure species and hybrid Populus spp. clones. The plantation established on degraded land in Boom, Belgium, was maintained as a low-energy input system, i.e. no irrigation, no fertilizers and no fungicides were applied. The average dry biomass yield during the fourth rotation was 4.3{\textpm}3.4tonha-1 year-1 across all clones, but the most productive clones yielded up to 10.5tonha-1 year-1. After 16 years, stool survival ranged from 6 to 91\% among clones. Our results demonstrated the sustained biomass potential and resprouting capacity after a severe leaf rust attack and after several harvests of the studied Populus nigra and Populus trichocarpa clones as opposed to hybrids between Populus deltoides and P. trichocarpa which hardly survived the fourth rotation. These findings suggest that pure species might perform better than hybrids under suboptimal conditions, e.g. on degraded lands, throughout several harvest cycles and/or after leaf rust infestations. Despite the relatively low yields, the investigated system on degraded land had a positive energy balance producing 7.9 times more energy than it consumed from cradle to plant gate. {\copyright} 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Salvage logging is one of most frequently applied management responses to forest disturbances world-wide. As forest disturbances are increasing, so too is the application of salvage logging, yet its effects on ecosystems remains incompletely understood. In the Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests of Europe, salvaging of windfelled trees is inter alia applied to reduce the risk of bark beetle outbreaks (mainly Ips typographus L.). By preventing further disturbances, salvage logging can conserve live tree carbon (C) in forest landscapes. At the same time salvage logging reduces C stocks in detrital pools via the extraction of disturbed trees, its net effect thus remains unclear. We used the forest landscape model iLand to explore the effect of a wide range of salvaging intensities on (a) subsequent bark beetle outbreaks, and (b) landscape-scale forest C stocks in a Norway spruce-dominated production forest in Slovakia under past and future climatic conditions. Climate change resulted in a two- to three-fold increase in bark beetle disturbances throughout the 21st century in our simulations. We found that removing {$>$}95\% of disturbed trees can effectively buffer the effect of increasing disturbances, dampening bark beetle infestations and increasing live tree C. Total ecosystem C followed a U-shaped pattern over salvaging intensity, with highest values in no salvage and 100\% salvage scenarios. However, realistic rates of salvaging ({$<$}95\% of disturbed trees detected and removed) had no significant effect on bark beetle dynamics and live tree C, and reduced the total ecosystem C stored in the landscape. Furthermore, the effect of reduced bark beetle disturbance under intensive salvaging was partly offset by increased wind disturbance. Synthesis and applications. Clearing disturbed areas to prevent future disturbances from bark beetles and conserve live tree carbon should only be applied where very high salvaging rates are feasible (i.e. small and concentrated disturbances). Considering that changing disturbance regimes make high-intensity salvaging increasingly challenging, alternative disturbance management approaches need to be developed.},

  abstract = {Global land surface characteristics are important boundary conditions for global models that describe exchanges of water, energy, and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and biosphere. Existing data sets of global land cover are based on classification schemes that characterize each grid cell as a discrete vegetation type. Consequently, parameter fields derived from these data sets are dependent on the particular scheme and the number of vegetation types it includes. The functional controls on exchanges of water, energy, and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and biosphere are now well enough understood that it is increasingly feasible to model these exchanges using a small number of vegetation characteristics that either are related to or closely related to the functional controls. Ideally, these characteristics would be mapped as continuous distributions to capture mixtures and gradients in vegetation within the cell size of the model. While such an approach makes it more difficult to build models from detailed observations at a small number of sites, it increases the potential for capturing functionally important variation within, as well as between, vegetation types. Globally, the vegetation characteristics that appear to be most important in controlling fluxes of water, energy, and carbon dioxide include (1) growth form (tree, shrub, herb), (2) seasonality of woody vegetation (deciduous, evergreen), (3) leaf type (broadleaf, coniferous), (4) photosynthetic pathway of nonwoody vegetation (C3, C4), (5) longevity (annual, perennial), and (6) type and intensity of disturbance (e.g., cultivation, fire history). Many of these characteristics can be obtained through remote sensing, though some require ground-based information. The minimum number and the identity of the required land surface characteristics almost certainly vary with the intended objective, but the philosophy of driving models with continuous distributions of a small number of land surface characteristics is likely to be applicable to a broad range of problems.}

A pyranometer measures global shortwave radiation, combining both direct and diffuse solar radiation into a single measurement. A pyrheliometer is a narrow aperture instrument that measures only the direct beam component of solar radiation. Diffuse irradiance is typically measured using a pyranometer that is shaded from the direct beam of the sun with a solar tracking shade disk. Fundamentally, modern pyranometers are based on either a thermoelectric (thermopile, black body) or a photoelectric (silicon photodiode) response. Pyranometers are subject to errors associated with characteristics of the sensor (cosine, spectral, and temperature responses), and general use (installation, dirt, moisture, and aging). Conservative estimates for measurement uncertainty are about 2 to 3 percent for thermopile and 3 to 6 percent for silicon photodiode pyranometers. .},

  abstract = {Eucalyptus globulus Labill., a globally significant plantation species, is grown commercially in a multiple rotation framework. Second and subsequent crops of E. globulus may be established either by allowing the cut stumps to resprout (commonly referred to as coppice) or by replanting a new crop of seedlings. Currently, long-term growth data comparing coppice and seedling productivity in second or later rotations in southern Australia is limited. The capacity to predict productivity using these tools is dependent on an understanding of the physiology of seedlings and coppice in response to light, water and nutrient supply. In this study, we compared the intrinsic (independent of the immediate environment) and native (dependent on the immediate environment) physiology of E. globulus coppice and second-generation seedlings during their early development in the field. Coppice not only grew more rapidly, but also used more water and drew on stored soil water to a depth of at least 4.5 m during the first 2 years of growth, whereas the seedlings only accessed the top 0.9 m of the soil profile. During the same period, there was no significant difference between coppice and seedlings in either their stomatal response to leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference (D) or intrinsic water-use efficiency; CO 2- and light-saturated rates of photosynthesis were greater in seedlings than that in coppice as were the quantum yield of photosynthesis and total leaf chlorophyll content. Thus, at a leaf scale, seedlings are potentially more productive per unit leaf area than coppice during early development, but this is not realised under ambient conditions. The underlying cause of this inherent difference is discussed in the context of the allocation of resources to above- and below-ground organs during early development.},

However, global maps of nutrient limitation are still lacking. Here we examined global N and P limitation using the ratio of site-averaged leaf N and P resorption efficiencies of the dominant species across 171 sites. We evaluated our predictions using a global database of N- and P-limitation experiments based on nutrient additions at 106 and 53 sites, respectively. Globally, we found a shift from relative P to N limitation for both higher latitudes and precipitation seasonality and lower mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality, mean annual precipitation and soil clay fraction. Excluding cropland, urban and glacial areas, we estimate that 18\% of the natural terrestrial land area is significantly limited by N, whereas 43\% is relatively P limited. The remaining 39\% of the natural terrestrial land area could be co-limited by N and P or weakly limited by either nutrient alone. This work provides both a new framework for testing nutrient limitation and a benchmark of N and P limitation for models to constrain predictions of the terrestrial carbon sink.},

We show that the mean temperature of the warmest quarter (3-month period) passed the thermal maximum for photosynthesis during the past decade. At higher temperatures, respiration rates continue to rise in contrast to sharply declining rates of photosynthesis. Under business-as-usual emissions, this divergence elicits a near halving of the land sink strength by as early as 2040.},

  abstract = {We present the global general circulation model IPSL-CM5 developed to study the long-term response of the climate system to natural and anthropogenic forcings as part of the 5th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This model includes an interactive carbon cycle, a representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, and a comprehensive representation of aerosols. As it represents the principal dynamical, physical, and bio-geochemical processes relevant to the climate system, it may be referred to as an Earth System Model. However, the IPSL-CM5 model may be used in a multitude of configurations associated with different boundary conditions and with a range of complexities in terms of processes and interactions. This paper presents an overview of the different model components and explains how they were coupled and used to simulate historical climate changes over the past 150 years and different scenarios of future climate change. A single version of the IPSL-CM5 model (IPSL-CM5A-LR) was used to provide climate projections associated with different socio-economic scenarios, including the different Representative Concentration Pathways considered by CMIP5 and several scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios considered by CMIP3. Results suggest that the magnitude of global warming projections primarily depends on the socio-economic scenario considered, that there is potential for an aggressive mitigation policy to limit global warming to about two degrees, and that the behavior of some components of the climate system such as the Arctic sea ice and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation may change drastically by the end of the twenty-first century in the case of a no climate policy scenario. Although the magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes depends fairly linearly on the magnitude of the projected global warming (and thus on the scenario considered), the geographical pattern of these changes is strikingly similar for the different scenarios. The representation of atmospheric physical processes in the model is shown to strongly influence the simulated climate variability and both the magnitude and pattern of the projected climate changes. {\copyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Background: United States forests can contribute to national strategies for greenhouse gas reductions. The objective of this work was to evaluate forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios from 2018 to 2050 by applying a systems-based approach that accounts for net emissions across four interdependent components: (1) forest ecosystem, (2) land-use change, (3) harvested wood products, and (4) substitution benefits from using wood products and bioenergy. We assessed a range of land management and harvested wood product scenarios for two case studies in the U.S: coastal South Carolina and Northern Wisconsin. We integrated forest inventory and remotely-sensed disturbance data within a modelling framework consisting of a growth-and-yield driven ecosystem carbon model; a harvested wood products model that estimates emissions from commodity production, use and post-consumer treatment; and displacement factors to estimate avoided fossil fuel emissions. We estimated biophysical mitigation potential by comparing net emissions from land management and harvested wood products scenarios with a baseline ('business as usual') scenario. Results: Baseline scenario results showed that the strength of the ecosystem carbon sink has been decreasing in the two sites due to age-related productivity declines and deforestation. Mitigation activities have the potential to lessen or delay the further reduction in the carbon sink. Results of the mitigation analysis indicated that scenarios reducing net forest area loss were most effective in South Carolina, while extending harvest rotations and increasing longer-lived wood products were most effective in Wisconsin. Scenarios aimed at increasing bioenergy use either increased or reduced net emissions within the 32-year analysis timeframe. Conclusions: It is critical to apply a systems approach to comprehensively assess net emissions from forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios. Although some scenarios produced a benefit by displacing emissions from fossil fuel energy or by substituting wood products for other materials, these benefits can be outweighed by increased carbon emissions in the forest or product systems. Maintaining forests as forests, extending rotations, and shifting commodities to longer-lived products had the strongest mitigation benefits over several decades. Carbon cycle impacts of bioenergy depend on timeframe, feedstocks, and alternative uses of biomass, and cannot be assumed carbon neutral.},

In long-lived organisms such as trees, genetic adaptation is slow, and how much phenotypic plasticity can help them cope with climate change remains largely unknown. Here, we assess whether, where and when phenological plasticity is and will be adaptive in three major European tree species. We use a process-based species distribution model, parameterized with extensive ecological data, and manipulate plasticity to suppress phenological variations due to interannual, geographical and trend climate variability, under current and projected climatic conditions. We show that phenological plasticity is not always adaptive and mostly affects fitness at the margins of the species' distribution and climatic niche. Under current climatic conditions, phenological plasticity constrains the northern range limit of oak and beech and the southern range limit of pine. Under future climatic conditions, phenological plasticity becomes strongly adaptive towards the trailing edges of beech and oak, but severely constrains the range and niche of pine. Our results call for caution when interpreting geographical variation in trait means as adaptive, and strongly point towards species distribution models explicitly taking phenotypic plasticity into account when forecasting species distribution under climate change scenarios.},

The performance of version 2. 2 (V2. 2) of the model is compared to observations, reanalysis data and other coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice models. The large-scale physical characteristics of the atmosphere, ocean and sea ice are well simulated. When compared to other coupled models with similar complexity, the model performs well in simulating tropospheric fields and dynamic variables, and performs less in simulating surface temperature and fluxes. The surface temperatures are too cold, with the exception of the Southern Ocean region and parts of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. The main patterns of interannual climate variability are well represented. Experiments with enhanced CO2 concentrations show well-known responses of Arctic amplification, land-sea contrasts, tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. The global climate sensitivity of the current version of EC-Earth is slightly less than 1 K/(W m-2). An intensification of the hydrological cycle is found and strong regional changes in precipitation, affecting monsoon characteristics. The results show that a coupled model based on an operational seasonal prediction system can be used for climate studies, supporting emerging seamless prediction strategies. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

We also examined land cover development and meteorological data for the same period.11-year time series of MODIS 16-day composite NDVI data proved sufficient for deriving statistically significant trend values for 50\% of Mongolia's surface. MODIS land cover products proved suitable for identifying areas of vegetation cover change. Areas showing positive and negative NDVI trends mostly coincided with areas of land cover class change indicating an increase or a decrease in vegetation, respectively. Precipitation changes in the same time period seem to have had an influence on large NDVI trend areas. The NDVI time series trend analysis methodology applied successfully detected changes due to deforestation, forest fires, mining activities, urban expansion, and grassland regeneration. These findings demonstrate that NDVI time series trend analysis is suitable for detecting vegetation change areas and for identifying land degradation and regeneration.},

  abstract = {Land surface models (LSMs) typically use empirical functions to represent vegetation responses to soil drought. These functions largely neglect recent advances in plant ecophysiology that link xylem hydraulic functioning with stomatal responses to climate. We developed an analytical stomatal optimization model based on xylem hydraulics (SOX) to predict plant responses to drought. Coupling SOX to the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) LSM, we conducted a global evaluation of SOX against leaf- and ecosystem-level observations. SOX simulates leaf stomatal conductance responses to climate for woody plants more accurately and parsimoniously than the existing JULES stomatal conductance model. An ecosystem-level evaluation at 70 eddy flux sites shows that SOX decreases the sensitivity of gross primary productivity (GPP) to soil moisture, which improves the model agreement with observations and increases the predicted annual GPP by 30\% in relation to JULES. SOX decreases JULES root-mean-square error in GPP by up to 45\% in evergreen tropical forests, and can simulate realistic patterns of canopy water potential and soil water dynamics at the studied sites. SOX provides a parsimonious way to incorporate recent advances in plant hydraulics and optimality theory into LSMs, and an alternative to empirical stress factors.},

Yet, a lingering paradigm among natural scientists, conservationists, and policymakers is that human transformation of terrestrial nature is mostly recent and inherently destructive. Here, we use the most up-to-date, spatially explicit global reconstruction of historical human populations and land use to show that this paradigm is likely wrong. Even 12,000 y ago, nearly three quarters of Earth's land was inhabited and therefore shaped by human societies, including more than 95\% of temperate and 90\% of tropical woodlands. Lands now characterized as ``natural,'' ``intact,'' and ``wild'' generally exhibit long histories of use, as do protected areas and Indigenous lands, and current global patterns of vertebrate species richness and key biodiversity areas are more strongly associated with past patterns of land use than with present ones in regional landscapes now characterized as natural. The current biodiversity crisis can seldom be explained by the loss of uninhabited wildlands, resulting instead from the appropriation, colonization, and intensifying use of the biodiverse cultural landscapes long shaped and sustained by prior societies. Recognizing this deep cultural connection with biodiversity will therefore be essential to resolve the crisis.},

  abstract = {North American forests are threatened by changes in climate and disturbance dynamics. Current efforts to model future vegetation and fire dynamics are challenged by the lack of mechanistic representation of ecological processes, the spatial resolution to capture landscape-level heterogeneity, and the ability to model regional spatial extents. To address these gaps, a dynamic vegetation model was adapted for regional applications to the western forests of the U.S. Here we present LPJ-GUESS-LMfireCF, a dynamic vegetation model that includes the ecological processes of a dynamic global vegetation model with cohort-based forest demography (LPJ-GUESS) and a mechanistic fire module (LMfire), with a newly developed routine to simulate stand-replacing crown fires (CF). The LMfireCF fire module calculates surface fire and canopy characteristics to determine if critical conditions are met for crown fire initiation and spread, and if met, calculates crown fire effects. Adapting the model to regional applications required parameterization of dominant regional plant functional types (PFTs) and additional model adjustments related to the representation of fire. Simulations driven by historical climate data from 1980 to 2016 were made to compare the two different fire modules: the original GlobFIRM and newly created LMfireCF, and two different plant functional type (PFT) parameterizations: the original global vs. newly created regional PFTs. Model performance was evaluated by comparing simulation outputs to field and satellite-based estimates for landscape biomass distribution, dominant plant cover, fire activity, and forest regeneration. LPJ-GUESS-LMfireCF accurately represented vegetational zones with elevation and climate gradients in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Total carbon in aboveground live vegetation within YNP simulated by LPJ-GUESS-LMfireCF with the regional PFTs overestimated satellite-based estimates by 12\% (44.8 TgC vs 39.9 TgC respectively). In comparison, an LPJ-GUESS simulation using the older GlobFIRM fire module and global PFTs resulted in total carbon in aboveground live vegetation of 225 Tg C for YNP, five times the satellite-based estimates. LPJ-GUESS-LMfireCF simulated burned area and fire severity approximated satellite-based observations. Importantly, LPJ-GUESS-LMfireCF simulated the large stand-replacing fires of 1988 in Yellowstone as emergent results without model initialization of vegetation cover or fire history. LPJ-GUESS-LMfireCF simulated that 25\% of the area of YNP burned in 1988, compared to 36\% based on field and satellite-based estimates. However, modeled postfire regrowth was more rapid than field-based estimations, with simulated mean biomass 24 years postfire (40.1 {\textpm} 1.65 Mg ha-1) 58\% greater than field estimations (25.4 {\textpm} 2.5 Mg ha-1), yet simulated mean biomass for mature forests ({$>$}100 years old without a major disturbance) was 24\% less than field estimations (58.4 {\textpm} 0.8 compared to 76.6 {\textpm} 3.5 Mg ha-1). In summary, LPJ-GUESS-LMfireCF effectively simulates regional crown fire dynamics and vegetation to more accurately model regional biomass, plant biogeography, and fire activity.},

A SRES B2 run of the coupled atmosphere and ocean model ECHAM4 - OPYC3 of the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology (Hamburg, Germany) and observations from several hundred climate stations of the German Weather Service are used as input data for the presented statistical model. The method described in this paper utilizes an objective circulation pattern classification and a specific weather generator to indicate the mean regional changes between present day climate and the future projection. A circulation pattern dependent regression is used to model future climate extremes resulting from changed intensities of atmospherical processes within the individual circulation patterns. The presented results are a composite of five regional climate studies. Generally the following statements can be inferred from our results: The predicted climate change will not progress uniformly. Instead, periods characterized by rather slight changes will be followed by others exhibiting very distinct climatologic alterations. The strongest change is identified in winter. Until the decade 2041-50 an increase of approximately 3 K and a raise of the rainfall amounts are predicted compared to the present day climate (1981-2000). This is caused by an increase of zonal circulation patterns. In summer the change is weaker but still significant. The temperature will increase approx. 2 K while rainfall will decrease especially in the south and east of Germany. The changes within the transitional seasons will be moderate compared to those within summer and winter. {\copyright} Gebr{\"u}der Borntraeger, Berlin, Stuttgart 2005.},

  abstract = {Carbon stocks in vegetation have a key role in the climate system. However, the magnitude, patterns and uncertainties of carbon stocks and the effect of land use on the stocks remain poorly quantified. Here we show, using state-of-the-art datasets, that vegetation currently stores around 450 petagrams of carbon. In the hypothetical absence of land use, potential vegetation would store around 916 petagrams of carbon, under current climate conditions. This difference highlights the massive effect of land use on biomass stocks. Deforestation and other land-cover changes are responsible for 53-58\% of the difference between current and potential biomass stocks. Land management effects (the biomass stock changes induced by land use within the same land cover) contribute 42-47\%, but have been underestimated in the literature. Therefore, avoiding deforestation is necessary but not sufficient for mitigation of climate change. Our results imply that trade-offs exist between conserving carbon stocks on managed land and raising the contribution of biomass to raw material and energy supply for the mitigation of climate change. Efforts to raise biomass stocks are currently verifiable only in temperate forests, where their potential is limited. By contrast, large uncertainties hinder verification in the tropical forest, where the largest potential is located, pointing to challenges for the upcoming stocktaking exercises under the Paris agreement.},

  abstract = {Forest-based mitigation strategies will play a pivotal role in achieving the rapid and deep net-emission reductions required to prevent catastrophic climate change. However, large disagreement prevails on how to forge forest-based mitigation strategies, in particular in regions where forests are currently growing in area and carbon density. Two opposing viewpoints prevail in the current discourse: (1) A widespread viewpoint, specifically in countries in the Global North, favours enhanced wood use, including bioenergy, for substitution of emissions-intensive products and processes. (2) Others instead focus on the biophysical, resource-efficiency and time-response advantages of forest conservation and restoration for carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation, whilst often not explicitly specifying how much wood extraction can still safeguard these ecological benefits. We here argue for a new perspective in sustainable forest research that aims at forging ``no-regret'' forest-based climate change mitigation strategies. Based on the consideration of forest growth dynamics and the opportunity carbon cost associated with wood use, we suggest that, instead of taking (hypothetical) wood-for-fossil substitution as starting point in assessments of carbon implications of wood products and services, analyses should take the potential and desired carbon sequestration of forests as starting point and quantify sustainable yield potentials compatible with those carbon sequestration potentials. Such an approach explicitly addresses the possible benefits provided by forests as carbon sinks, brings research on the permanence and vulnerability of C-stocks in forests, of substitution effects, as well as explorations of demand-side strategies to the forefront of research and, in particular, aligns better with the urgency to find viable climate solutions.},

Each new law reduces annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 0.78\% nationally in the short term (during the first three years) and by 1.79\% in the long term (beyond three years). The results are driven by parliamentary acts and by countries with a strong rule of law. In 2016, current climate laws were associated with an annual reduction in global CO2 emissions of 5.9 GtCO2, more than the US CO2 output that year. Cumulative CO2 emissions savings from 1999 to 2016 amount to 38 GtCO2, or one year's worth of global CO2 output. The impact on other greenhouse gases is much lower.},

This performance was expressed in terms of several conflicting on-site ecosystem services (ESS), namely water conservation, soil protection, carbon storage and monetary income. IIPT selects the best performing LUT on a per-land unit basis, that is the assignment of a LUT to a land unit is completely independent with respect to other land units. CP and BCP, on the other hand, aim at optimizing the integrated regional performance. These methods produce a LUT distribution that is as close as possible to the absolute optimal performance that would be achieved when conflict among ESS is not considered. In general, similar results were obtained with CP and BCP. This was not the case when the results produced by these two methods were contrasted with IIPT. For most ESS under consideration, CP and BCP produced balanced results that were closer to the absolute optimal values when compared to IIPT. We conclude from our results that, when optimization of land performance at a regional scale is at stake, CP-derived models emerge as the preferable option over IIPT, especially when balanced solutions are a requirement.},

  abstract = {A new high-resolution regional climate change ensemble has been established for Europe within the World Climate Research Program Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) initiative. The first set of simulations with a horizontal resolution of 12.5 km was completed for the new emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 with more simulations expected to follow. The aim of this paper is to present this data set to the different communities active in regional climate modelling, impact assessment and adaptation. The EURO-CORDEX ensemble results have been compared to the SRES A1B simulation results achieved within the ENSEMBLES project. The large-scale patterns of changes in mean temperature and precipitation are similar in all three scenarios, but they differ in regional details, which can partly be related to the higher resolution in EURO-CORDEX. The results strengthen those obtained in ENSEMBLES, but need further investigations. The analysis of impact indices shows that for RCP8.5, there is a substantially larger change projected for temperature-based indices than for RCP4.5. The difference is less pronounced for precipitation-based indices. Two effects of the increased resolution can be regarded as an added value of regional climate simulations. Regional climate model simulations provide higher daily precipitation intensities, which are completely missing in the global climate model simulations, and they provide a significantly different climate change of daily precipitation intensities resulting in a smoother shift from weak to moderate and high intensities. {\copyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

Leading scientists and forestry professionals have contributed in the many stages of the production of this atlas, through the collection of ground data on the location of tree species, elaboration of the distribution and suitability maps, production of the photographic material and compilation of the different chapters. The European Atlas of Forest Tree Species is both a scientific publication, in which researchers and forest specialists can find rigorous and up-to-date information on the many tree species of our forests and a publication suited for education and the dissemination of information about the richness of our forests to our generation and future generations. Trees, like all other forms of life, adapt to the conditions in which they live. This adaptation is reflected in the shape of their leaves, their seeds, and their strategy for dissemination and expansion. Each chapter of the Atlas presents, in addition to the description of each tree species, high-quality graphics and photographs showing the climatic preferences and singularities of the different species of trees. The European Atlas of Forest Tree Species includes not only the publication you are looking at, but also a dynamic database of information on our trees, their use, their threats, and eventually the changes that climate may bring about in our forests. This 1st edition of the European Atlas of Forest Tree Species will shortly be followed by the publication of an online version which will incorporate updated information of forest resources and their distribution. The European Atlas of Tree Species will thus be continuously updated as new information on tree species becomes available. Trees are an essential resource for human life. As well as being an important economic resource, they are also a reservoir for biodiversity; they protect our soils, purify our water, clean the air we breathe and populate the forests we use for recreation. We hope that this Atlas will help increase awareness about trees and all the benefits they provide to society.},

  abstract = {The photosynthetic capacity of leaves is related to the nitrogen content primarily bacause the proteins of the Calvin cycle and thylakoids represent the majority of leaf nitrogen. To a first approximation, thylakoid nitrogen is proportional to the chlorophyll content (50 mol thylakoid N mol-1 Chl). Within species there are strong linear relationships between nitrogen and both RuBP carboxylase and chlorophyll. With increasing nitrogen per unit leaf area, the proportion of total leaf nitrogen in the thylakoids remains the same while the proportion in soluble protein increases. In many species, growth under lower irradiance greatly increases the partitioning of nitrogen into chlorophyll and the thylakoids, while the electron transport capacity per unit of chlorophyll declines. If growth irradiance influences the relationship between photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen content, predicting nitrogen distribution between leaves in a canopy becomes more complicated. When both photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen content are expressed on the basis of leaf area, considerable variation in the photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf nitrogen content is found between species. The variation reflects different strategies of nitrogen partitioning, the electron transport capacity per unit of chlorophyll and the specific activity of RuBP carboxylase. Survival in certain environments clearly does not require maximising photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf nitrogen content. Species that flourish in the shade partition relatively more nitrogen into the thylakoids, although this is associated with lower photosynthetic capacity per unit of nitrogen. {\copyright} 1989 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Abstract. By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850--near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: -- How does the Earth system respond to forcing? -- What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? -- How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

The global diffusion of fossil fuels reduced this leadership and the coppice system turned, to some extent, to a reminder of the past. Nowadays, the ongoing global changes and the related green-economy issues call for resilient systems and effective bio-energy producers. These issues have caused a second turning point and the coppice has returned fifty years later to play a role. A review of the silvicultural system has been carried out with a special focus on the changes which have occurred in between, taking Italy as a consistent case-study. The analysis is mainly framed upon the long-term research trials established by the CREA-Forestry Research Centre in the late sixties, to find out adaptive management strategies and overcome the system's crisis. The findings and further knowledge achieved so far on the dynamics and functioning of coppice forests in the outgrown phase, both as natural evolutive patterns and silviculture-driven processes, are highlighted in this paper. They provide useful tools to handle the management shift regarding forthcoming issues, i.e. the current role attributable to the coppice system within the changing environment and the renewable energy demand. The basic features of each management area and their complementarities within the current framework are outlined.},

Adaptation to climate risks that can no longer be avoided is an important aspect of the global response to climate change. Humans have always adapted to changing climatic conditions, and there is growing, if still patchy, evidence of widespread adaptation behavior. However, adaptation is not autonomous as sometimes claimed. It requires knowledge, planning, coordination, and foresight. There are important knowledge gaps, behavioral barriers, and market failures that hold back effective adaptation and require policy intervention. We identify the most urgent adaptation priorities, including areas where delay might lock in future vulnerability, and outline the decision-making challenges of adapting to an unknown future climate. We also highlight the strong interlinkages between adaptation and economic development, pointing out that decisions on industrial strategy, urban planning, and infrastructure investment all have a strong bearing on future vulnerability to climate change. We review the implications of these links for adaptation finance and what the literature tells us about the balance between adaptation and mitigation.},

  abstract = {Troughout its history the principle of compositionality, a widely acknowledged cornerstone for any theory of meaning, has been closely associated with what one might call the principle of semantic constituency. The latter characterizes the subclass of the symbolic theories of meaning. In this chapter a neurobiologically motivated theory of meaning as internal representation will be developed that holds on to the principle of compositionality, but negates the principle of semantic constituency. It is in this sense non-symbolic. The approach builds on neurobiological findings regarding topologically structured cortical feature maps and the mechanism of object-related binding by neuronal synchronization. It incorporates the Gestalt principles of psychology and is implemented by recurrent neural networks. The semantics to be developed is structural analogous - yes, in fact isomorphic - to some variant of model-theoretical semantics, which likewise is compositional and non-symbolic. However, unlike standard model-theoretical semantics, it regards meanings as set-theoretical constructions not of denotations, but of their neural counterparts or, as we will say, their emulations. The semantics to be developed is a neuro-emulative model-theoretical semantics of a first- order language.},

For some people, nature is a direct source of food, clean water, and energy through subsistence uses. However, a high direct dependency on nature for basic needs makes people particularly sensitive to changes in climate, land cover, and land tenure. Based on more than 5 million household interviews conducted in 85 tropical countries, we identified where people highly depend on nature for their basic needs. Our results show that 1.2 billion people, or 30\% of the population across tropical countries, are highly dependent on nature. In places where people highly depend on nature for their basic needs, nature-based strategies that protect, restore or sustainably manage ecosystems must be carefully designed to promote inclusive human development alongside environmental benefits.},

The latter lapse rate feedback is subject, at high latitudes, to a myriad of local and remote influences whose relative contributions remain unquantified. The distinct controls on the high-latitude lapse rate feedback are here partitioned into ``upper'' and ``lower'' contributions originating above and below a characteristic climatological isentropic surface that separates the high-latitude lower troposphere from the rest of the atmosphere. This decomposition clarifies how the positive high-latitude lapse rate feedback over polar oceans arises primarily as an atmospheric response to local sea ice loss and is reduced in subpolar latitudes by an increase in poleward atmospheric energy transport. The separation of the locally driven component of the high-latitude lapse rate feedback further reveals how it and the sea-ice albedo feedback together dominate Arctic amplification as a coupled mechanism operating across the seasonal cycle.},

  abstract = {Conifer dominated plantations in central and northern Europe are associated with relatively low ecological values, and in some cases, may be vulnerable to disturbances caused by anthropogenic climate change. This has prompted the consideration of alternative tree species compositions for use in production forestry in this region. Here we evaluate the likely biodiversity costs and benefits of supplanting Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures with polycultures of spruce and birch (Betula spp.) in southern Sweden. This polyculture alternative has previously been evaluated in terms of economic, recreational, and silvicultural benefits. By also assessing the ecological implications we fill a gap in our understanding of the range of socio-ecological benefits that can be achieved from a single polyculture alternative. We project likely broad scale changes to species richness and abundance within production stands for five taxonomic groups including ground vegetation, tree-living bryophytes, lichens, saproxylic beetles, and birds. Our research leads us to three key findings. First, the replacement of spruce monocultures with spruce-birch polycultures in the managed forest landscapes of southern Sweden can be expected to result in an increase in biological diversity for most but not all taxa assessed, but it is unlikely to improve conditions for many red-listed forest species. Second, modification of other aspects of forest management (i.e. rotation length, dead wood and green tree retention, thinning regimes) is likely to contribute to further biodiversity gains using spruce-birch polycultures than spruce monocultures. Third, the paucity of empirical research which directly compares the biodiversity of different types of managed production stands, limits the extent to which policy relevant conclusions can be extracted from the scientific literature. We discuss the wider implications of our findings, which indicate that some climate change adaptation strategies, such as risk-spreading, can be readily integrated with the economic, environmental and social goals of multi-use forestry. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is altering themanagement of production forests. These changes are motivated by the need to adapt to the uncertainties and risks of climate change, and by the need to enlist their carbon storage and sequestration capacity as part of global mitigation efforts. These changes do however raise concerns regarding the potential implications for forest biodiversity. Here we evaluate these concerns by assessing the biodiversity implications of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies (CCAMS) being implemented in the production forests of Sweden. We do so by identifying biodiversity goals aimed specifically at closing the existing gap between the habitat requirements of forest-dependent species, and the conditions provided by production forests, in terms of tree species composition, forest structures, and spatio-temporal forest patterns. We then use the existing literature to determinewhether and bywhich pathway each CCAMS is likely to bridge or extend this gap. Our results indicate that CCAMS will often come into direct or partial conflict with Swedish biodiversity goals in production forests. Furthermore, some CCAMS which are inconsistent with biodiversity goals, such as logging residue removal, are being implemented more extensively than those which were most consistent with biodiversity goals. We nevertheless challenge the necessity of setting the preservation of forest biodiversity against climate change mitigation and adaptation. Weclarify howCCAMS with negative biodiversity implications may still be implemented without adverse outcomes, if coupled with conservation interventions, or combined with other CCAMS deemed complementary in habitat provision.},

Hence, knowledge of their nutritional demands and limitations for activity and growth is of particular importance. However, potential effects of the stoichiometry of soil and plant species on soil microbial activity and carbon use efficiency are poorly understood. Soil properties and plant traits are assumed to drive microbial carbon and community structure. We investigated the associations between C and N concentrations of leaf, root, and soil as well as their ratios and soil microbial biomass C and activity (microbial basal respiration and specific respiratory quotient) across 32 young native angiosperm tree species at two locations in Central Germany. Correlations between C:N ratios of leaves, roots, and soil were positive but overall weak. Only regressions between root and leaf C:N ratios as well as between root and soil C:N ratios were significant at one site. Soil microbial properties differed significantly between the two sites and were significantly correlated with soil C:N ratio across sites. Soil C concentrations rather than N concentrations drove significant effects of soil C:N ratio on soil microbial properties. No significant correlations between soil microbial properties and leaf as well as root C:N ratios were found. We found weak correlations of C:N ratios between plant aboveground and belowground tissues. Furthermore, microorganisms were not affected by the stoichiometry of plant tissues in the investigated young trees. The results suggest that soil stoichiometry represents a consistent determinant of soil microbial biomass and respiration. Our study indicates that stoichiometric relationships among tree organs can be weak and poor predictors of soil microbial properties in young tree stands. Further research in controlled experimental settings with a wide range of tree species is needed to study the role of plant chemical traits like the composition and stoichiometry of root exudates in determining interactions between above- and belowground compartments.},

Computer simulation, case studies, and analysis of the fire regime in the presence of active prescribed burning programs in forest and shrubland generally indicate that this fuel management tool facilitates fire suppression efforts by reducing the intensity, size and damage of wildfires. However, the conclusions that can be drawn from the above approaches are limited, highlighting the need for more properly designed experiments addressing this question. Fuel accumulation rate frequently limits prescribed fire effectiveness to a short post-treatment period (2-4 years). Optimisation of the spatial pattern of fire application is critical but has been poorly addressed by research, and practical management guidelines are lacking to initiate this. Furthermore, adequate treatment efforts in terms of fire protection are constrained by operational, social and ecological issues. The best results of prescribed fire application are likely to be attained in heterogeneous landscapes and in climates where the likelihood of extreme weather conditions is low. Conclusive statements concerning the hazard-reduction potential of prescribed fire are not easily generalised, and will ultimately depend on the overall efficiency of the entire fire management process.},

  abstract = {Mediterranean landscapes are in a state of flux due to the impacts of changing land-use patterns and climate. Fuel-weather interactions determine that large, severe wildfires are increasingly common. Prescribed burning in southern Europe is therefore justified by the need to manage fire-prone vegetation types and maintain cultural landscapes that provide a range of ecosystem services. Prescribed fire has neutral or positive effects on soils and biodiversity, in contrast to wildfires, which can be extremely damaging. However, the limited extent of current applications are unlikely to reduce wildfire hazard or carbon emissions. Adoption of prescribed burning in the Mediterranean region has been slow, uneven, and inconsistent, and its development is constrained by cultural and socioeconomic factors as well as by specific factors related to demography, land use, and landscape structure. Sustainable fire management requires expansion of managers' ability to use prescribed burning, a varied response to unplanned fires, and modified regulation of burning associated with traditional agricultural land uses. {\copyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

Using time series of flux observations from 23 forests distributed throughout Europe and the USA, and generalised mixed models, we found that forest-level net ecosystem production and gross primary production have increased by 1\% annually from 1995 to 2011. Statistical models indicated that increasing atmospheric CO2 was the most important factor driving the increasing strength of carbon sinks in these forests. We also found that the reduction of sulphur deposition in Europe and the USA lead to higher recovery in ecosystem respiration than in gross primary production, thus limiting the increase of carbon sequestration. By contrast, trends in climate and nitrogen deposition did not significantly contribute to changing carbon fluxes during the studied period. Our findings support the hypothesis of a general CO2-fertilization effect on vegetation growth and suggest that, so far unknown, sulphur deposition plays a significant role in the carbon balance of forests in industrialized regions. Our results show the need to include the effects of changing atmospheric composition, beyond CO2, to assess future dynamics of carbon-climate feedbacks not currently considered in earth system/climate modelling.},

The influence of Swiss needle cast (SNC) on coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii [Mirb] Franco) LAI and litterfall dynamics was quantified by destructively sampling 122 stems from 36 different permanent plots throughout north coastal Oregon, USA, and by monitoring litterfall for 3 years in 15 of these plots. LAI, total annual litterfall, and the seasonal distribution of foliage and fine woody litterfall were all influenced by stand structural attributes, physiographic features, and SNC severity. Mean LAI in this study was 5.44 {\textpm} 2.16. The relatively low LAIs were attributed primarily to the effects of SNC on foliage retention, and secondarily to its direct measurement by hierarchical foliage sampling in contrast to indirect measurement by light interception or tree allometry. For a given stand structure and SNC severity, LAI was 36\% greater in the fall after current year foliage was fully developed and older aged classes had not yet senesced. Annual litterfall expressed as a proportion of LAI at the start of the growing season varied from 0.13 to 0.53 and declined with increasing initial LAI. SNC also shifted more of the annual foliage litterfall to earlier in the spring. Fine woody litterfall experienced a different seasonal shift as the peak occurred later in the year on sites with high SNC, but this only occurred on northerly aspects. Defoliation fromthe endemic SNC pathogen can drastically reduce LAI and change both total and seasonal foliage litterfall patterns},

Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5--15\% (0.07--0.17 {$^\circ$}C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were {$\geq$} 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

  abstract = {We studied regeneration dynamics in forests disturbed by three different windthrow events in 2008 in Slovenia to assess the success of natural regeneration vs planting and subsequent silvicultural treatments. Fifty-three plots with planted saplings of Norway spruce and sycamore maple and 50 plots with dominant naturally regenerated saplings were selected in a randomly stratified manner. Sapling characteristics (height, height increment, root collar diameter, free-to-grow score, browsing and micro-site) were assessed in 2012 and 2014. Herbs and seedling establishment were studied in two subplots within each plot. Average seedling density was 13,074 and 14,674 ha-1 four and six years after the windthrows, respectively. Seedlings were irregularly distributed, which suggests micro-site differences in regeneration dynamics. The results indicated lower seedling success on sites that were southerly exposed, farther from the forest edge and seed trees, on undisturbed micro-sites and at higher altitudes. On such sites planting was justified. While seedling density indicated a positive relation to herb coverage, sapling survival was negatively associated with it as well as with browsing. Initial sapling height was the strongest predictor of survival. Spruce saplings had the lowest mortality, while shade-tolerant silver fir and beech experienced high mortality. The study indicated a high density and species diversity of naturally regenerated seedlings within windthrow areas, which was reduced by planting, mowing of competing vegetation and protection measures favouring planted saplings. Recommendations for the improvement of silvicultural operations for post windthrow restoration are given.},

The current research analyses the technical and economical long-term potential of innovative primary steel production technologies in Germany throughout 2100. Techno-economic models are used to simulate three innovative ore-based steelmaking routes verses the reference blast furnace route (BF-BOF). The innovative routes in focus are blast furnace with CCS1 (BF-CCS), hydrogen direct reduction (H-DR), and iron ore electrolysis (EW). Energy and mass flows for the production of one tonne of crude steel (CS) are combined with hypothetical price, cost, and revenue data to evaluate the production routes economically, technically, and environmentally. This is a purely theoretical analysis and hence further external factors that may influence practical implementation or profitability are not considered. Different future developments are considered by using three scenarios, representing an ambitious, a moderate, and a conservative transformation of the German energy sector. In general, looking into the future bares various uncertainties which should be reflected in a suitable manner.According to the present scenario analysis, chances are that with rising prices for coal and CO2 allowances BF-BOF and even BF-CCS become unprofitable by mid-century. With a high share of renewable energy sources and high prices for CO2 allowances, H-DR and EW become economically attractive in the second half of the current century, when BF-based routes are long unprofitable. Energy and raw material efficiency is significantly higher for H-DR and EW and furthermore, the 80\%reduction target by 20502 can be achieved in the ambitious scenario. However, high investment costs and high dependency on electricity prices prohibit a profitable implementation before 2030e2040 without further subsidies. EW is the most energy and resource efficient production route. Since continuous electricity is needed for the continuous operation, the electricity costs are 20e40\%higher than for H-DR (with high-capacity hydrogen storage units). Even though hydrogen production implies efficiency losses compared to the EW route, the decoupling of hydrogen production from continuous operation of the steel plant through hydrogen storage offers the opportunity to use cheap excess renewable electricity. This makes the H-DR economically and environmentally the most attractive route and provides a crucial contribution to stabilize the grid and to store excess energy in a 100\%renewable energy system.},

  abstract = {Global terrestrial models currently predict that the Amazon rainforest will continue to act as a carbon sink in the future, primarily owing to the rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. Soil phosphorus impoverishment in parts of the Amazon basin largely controls its functioning, but the role of phosphorus availability has not been considered in global model ensembles---for example, during the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project. Here we simulate the planned free-air CO2 enrichment experiment AmazonFACE with an ensemble of 14 terrestrial ecosystem models. We show that phosphorus availability reduces the projected CO2-induced biomass carbon growth by about 50\% to 79 {\textpm} 63 g C m-2 yr-1 over 15 years compared to estimates from carbon and carbon--nitrogen models. Our results suggest that the resilience of the region to climate change may be much less than previously assumed. Variation in the biomass carbon response among the phosphorus-enabled models is considerable, ranging from 5 to 140 g C m-2 yr-1, owing to the contrasting plant phosphorus use and acquisition strategies considered among the models. The Amazon forest response thus depends on the interactions and relative contributions of the phosphorus acquisition and use strategies across individuals, and to what extent these processes can be upregulated under elevated CO2.},

  abstract = {Changing trends in ecosystem productivity can be quantified using satellite observations of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). However, the estimation of trends from NDVI time series differs substantially depending on analyzed satellite dataset, the corresponding spatiotemporal resolution, and the applied statistical method. Here we compare the performance of a wide range of trend estimation methods and demonstrate that performance decreases with increasing inter-annual variability in the NDVI time series. Trend slope estimates based on annual aggregated time series or based on a seasonal-trend model show better performances than methods that remove the seasonal cycle of the time series. A breakpoint detection analysis reveals that an overestimation of breakpoints in NDVI trends can result in wrong or even opposite trend estimates. Based on our results, we give practical recommendations for the application of trend methods on long-term NDVI time series. Particularly, we apply and compare different methods on NDVI time series in Alaska, where both greening and browning trends have been previously observed. Here, the multi-method uncertainty of NDVI trends is quantified through the application of the different trend estimation methods. Our results indicate that greening NDVI trends in Alaska are more spatially and temporally prevalent than browning trends. We also show that detected breakpoints in NDVI trends tend to coincide with large fires. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that seasonal trend methods need to be improved against inter-annual variability to quantify changing trends in ecosystem productivity with higher accuracy. {\copyright} 2013 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Central to the development of Earth system models (ESMs) has been the coupling of previously separate model types, such as ocean, atmospheric, and vegetation models, to address interactive feedbacks between the system components. A modelling framework which combines a detailed representation of these components, including vegetation and other land surface processes, enables the study of land--atmosphere feedbacks under global climate change. Here we present the initial steps of coupling LPJ-GUESS, a dynamic global vegetation model, to the atmospheric chemistry-enabled atmosphere--ocean general circulation model EMAC. The LPJ-GUESS framework is based on ecophysiological processes, such as photosynthesis; plant and soil respiration; and ecosystem carbon, nitrogen, and water cycling, and it includes a comparatively detailed individual-based representation of resource competition, plant growth, and vegetation dynamics as well as fire disturbance. Although not enabled here, the model framework also includes a crop and managed-land scheme, a representation of arctic methane and permafrost, and a choice of fire models; and hence it represents many important terrestrial biosphere processes and provides a wide range of prognostic trace-gas emissions from vegetation, soil, and fire. We evaluated an online one-way-coupled model configuration (with climate variable being passed from EMAC to LPJ-GUESS but no return information flow) by conducting simulations at three spatial resolutions (T42, T63, and T85). These were compared to an expert-derived map of potential natural vegetation and four global gridded data products: tree cover, biomass, canopy height, and gross primary productivity (GPP). We also applied a post hoc land use correction to account for human land use. The simulations give a good description of the global potential natural vegetation distribution, although there are some regional discrepancies. In particular, at the lower spatial resolutions, a combination of low-temperature and low-radiation biases in the growing season of the EMAC climate at high latitudes causes an underestimation of vegetation extent. Quantification of the agreement with the gridded datasets using the normalised mean error (NME) averaged over all datasets shows that increasing the spatial resolution from T42 to T63 improved the agreement by 10 \%, and going from T63 to T85 improved the agreement by a further 4 \%. The highest-resolution simulation gave NME scores of 0.63, 0.66, 0.84, and 0.53 for tree cover, biomass, canopy height, and GPP, respectively (after correcting tree cover and biomass for human-caused deforestation which was not present in the simulations). These scores are just 4 \% worse on average than an offline LPJ-GUESS simulation using observed climate data and corrected for deforestation by the same method. However, it should be noted that the offline LPJ-GUESS simulation used a higher spatial resolution, which makes the evaluation more rigorous, and that excluding GPP from the datasets (which was anomalously better in the EMAC simulations) gave 10 \% worse agreement for the EMAC simulation than the offline simulation. Gross primary productivity was best simulated by the coupled simulations, and canopy height was the worst. Based on this first evaluation, we conclude that the coupled model provides a suitable means to simulate dynamic vegetation processes in EMAC.},

Mixed-species forests and increasing tree species diversity have been put forward as important risk reduction and adaptation strategies in the face of climate change. However, little is known about whether the species interactions that occur in diverse forests will reduce drought susceptibility or water stress. In this study, we focused on the effect of drought on individual tree species (n~=~16) within six regions of Europe and assessed whether this response was related to tree species diversity and stand density, and whether community-level responses resulted from many similar or contrasting species-level responses. For each species in each plot, we calculated the increase in carbon isotope composition of latewood from a wet to a dry year ({$\Delta\delta$}13C) as an estimate of its drought stress level. When significant community-level relationships occurred (three of six regions), there was only one species within the given community that showed a significant relationship (three of 25 species--region combinations), showing that information about a single species can be a poor indicator of the response of other species or the whole community. There were many two-species mixtures in which both species were less water-stressed compared with their monocultures, but also many mixtures where both species were more stressed compared with their monocultures. Furthermore, a given species combination responded differently in different regions. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that drought stress may sometimes be reduced in mixed-species forests, but this is not a general pattern, and even varies between sites for a given combination. The management or prediction of drought stress requires consideration of the physiological characteristics of the mixed species, and how this complements the water-related climatic and edaphic features of the site, rather than species richness.},

  abstract = {Through complementarity interactions, mixed-species forests can be more productive than monocultures, and this effect can increase with tree-species richness. However, this is not always the case. This review examines the processes and stand structural attributes that can influence diversity-productivity relationships (DPRs); how they influence resource availability, resource uptake, and resource-use efficiency; and also describes some important differences between tree-diversity versus grassland-diversity experiments. The size of the complementarity effects caused by these processes and stand structures varies along spatial and temporal gradients in resource availability and climate. These spatial and temporal dynamics have now been examined in many studies, and the general patterns are summarized using a simple framework; complementarity is predicted to increase as the availability of resource ``X'' declines (or climatic condition X becomes harsher) if the species interactions improve the availability, uptake, or use efficiency of resource X (or interactions improve climatic condition X). Importantly, this framework differs from the stress-gradient hypothesis to account for a wider range of inter-specific plant interactions (not only facilitation) by considering contrasting methods used to quantify species interactions while accounting for stand structure. In addition, complementarity (as opposed to facilitation) for a given species combination can increase as growing conditions improve in forests, contrary to predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis with regards to facilitation. This review indicates that while the effects of tree-species diversity on growth and other forest functions are now receiving a lot of attention, far less is known about the effects of structural diversity on growth or forest functioning. Direct measurements of the processes, as opposed to focusing mainly on growth responses, could greatly contribute to our understanding of structural diversity effects.},

  abstract = {Background: In preparation for the 2015 international climate negotiations in Paris, Parties submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) expressing each countries' respective post-2020 climate actions. In this paper we assess individual Parties' expected reduction of emissions/removals from land use, land use change, and forest (LULUCF) sector for reaching their INDC target, and the aggregate global effect on the INDCs on the future development of emission and removals from the LULUCF sector. This has been done through analysis Parties' official information concerning the role of LULUCF mitigation efforts for reaching INDC targets as presented in National Communications, Biennial Update Reports, and Additional file 1. Results: On the aggregate global level, the Parties themselves perceive that net LULUCF emissions will increase over time. Overall, the net LULUCF emissions are estimated to increase by 0.6 Gt CO2e year-1 (range: 0.1-1.1) in 2020 and 1.3 Gt CO2e year-1 (range: 0.7-2.1) in 2030, both compared to 2010 levels. On the other hand, the full implementation of the INDCs is estimated to lead to a reduction of net LULUCF emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 levels. It is estimated that if all conditional and unconditional INDCs are implemented, net LULUCF emissions would decrease by 0.5 Gt CO2e year-1 (range: 0.2-0.8) by 2020 and 0.9 Gt CO2e year-1 (range: 0.5-1.3) by 2030, both compared to 2010 levels. The largest absolute reductions of net LULUCF emissions (compared to 2010 levels) are expected from Indonesia and Brazil, followed by China and Ethiopia. Conclusions: The results highlights that countries are expecting a significant contribution from the LULUCF sector to meet their INDC mitigation targets. At the global level, the LULUCF sector is expected to contribute to as much as 20\% of the full mitigation potential of all the conditional and unconditional INDC targets. However, large uncertainties still surround how Parties estimate, project and account for emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector. While INDCs represent a new source of land-use information, further information and updates of the INDCs will be required to reduce uncertainty of the LULUCF projections.},

What-if scenarios vary: conifer-broadleaf composition, harvesting, product breakouts, and decarbonisation of substituted energy and materials, to estimate 100-year GHG mitigation. Here we find forest growth rate is the most important determinant of cumulative mitigation by 2120, irrespective of whether trees are harvested. A national planting strategy of commercial forest could mitigate 1.64 Pg CO 2 e by 2120 (cumulative), compared with 0.54--1.72 Pg CO 2 e for planting only conservation forests, depending on species composition. Even after heavy discounting of future product substitution credits based on industrial decarbonisation projections, GHG mitigation from harvested stands typically surpasses unharvested stands.

  abstract = {Forest disturbance regimes are expected to intensify as Earth's climate changes. Quantifying forest vulnerability to disturbances and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, observational evidence is largely missing at regional to continental scales. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of European forests to fires, windthrows and insect outbreaks during the period 1979--2018 by integrating machine learning with disturbance data and satellite products. We show that about 33.4 billion tonnes of forest biomass could be seriously affected by these disturbances, with higher relative losses when exposed to windthrows (40\%) and fires (34\%) compared to insect outbreaks (26\%). The spatial pattern in vulnerability is strongly controlled by the interplay between forest characteristics and background climate. Hotspot regions for vulnerability are located at the borders of the climate envelope, in both southern and northern Europe. There is a clear trend in overall forest vulnerability that is driven by a warming-induced reduction in plant defence mechanisms to insect outbreaks, especially at high latitudes.},

  abstract = {To keep global warming possibly below 1.5{\textopenbullet}C and mitigate adverse effects of climate change, agriculture, like all other sectors, will have to contribute to efforts in achieving net negative emissions by the end of the century. Cost-efficient distribution of mitigation across regions and economic sectors is typically calculated using a global uniform carbon price in climate stabilization scenarios. However, in reality such a carbon price would substantially affect food availability. Here, we assess the implications of climate change mitigation in the land use sector for agricultural production and food security using an integrated partial equilibrium modelling framework and explore ways of relaxing the competition between mitigation in agriculture and food availability. Using a scenario that limits global warming cost-efficiently across sectors to 1.5{\textopenbullet}C, results indicate global food calorie losses ranging from 110--285 kcal per capita per day in 2050 depending on the applied demand elasticities. This could translate into a rise in undernourishment of 80--300 million people in 2050. Less ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in the land use sector reduces the associated food security impact significantly, however the 1.5{\textopenbullet}C target would not be achieved without additional reductions outside the land use sector. Efficiency of GHG mitigation will also depend on the level of participation globally. Our results show that if non-Annex-I countries decide not to contribute to mitigation action while other parties pursue their mitigation efforts to reach the global climate target, food security impacts in these non-Annex-I countries will be higher than if they participate in a global agreement, as inefficient mitigation increases agricultural production costs and therefore food prices. Land-rich countries with a high proportion of emissions from land use change, such as Brazil, could reduce emissions with only a marginal effect on food availability. In contrast, agricultural mitigation in high population (density) countries, such as China and India, would lead to substantial food calorie loss without a major contribution to global GHG mitigation. Increasing soil carbon sequestration on agricultural land would allow reducing the implied calorie loss by 65\% when sticking to the initially estimated land use mitigation requirements, thereby limiting the impact on undernourishment to 20--75 million people, and storing significant amounts of carbon in soils.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {\textpm}1{$\sigma$}. For the year 2021, EFOS increased by 5.1 \% relative to 2020, with fossil emissions at 10.1 {\textpm} 0.5 GtC yr-1 (9.9 {\textpm} 0.5 GtC yr-1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.1 {\textpm} 0.7 GtC yr-1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission (including the cement carbonation sink) of 10.9 {\textpm} 0.8 GtC yr-1 (40.0 {\textpm} 2.9 GtCO2). Also, for 2021, GATM was 5.2 {\textpm} 0.2 GtC yr-1 (2.5 {\textpm} 0.1 ppm yr-1), SOCEAN was 2.9 {\textpm} 0.4 GtC yr-1, and SLAND was 3.5 {\textpm} 0.9 GtC yr-1, with a BIM of -0.6 GtC yr-1 (i.e. the total estimated sources were too low or sinks were too high). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2021 reached 414.71 {\textpm} 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2022 suggest an increase in EFOS relative to 2021 of +1.0 \% (0.1 \% to 1.9 \%) globally and atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 417.2 ppm, more than 50 \% above pre-industrial levels (around 278 ppm). Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959--2021, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr-1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use change emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extratropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set.

Main sources of CH4 and N2O emissions are agriculture-related activities such as enteric fermentation, paddy rice cultivation, soil management. A recursive dynamic CGE (Computer General Equilibrium) model has been developed to analyze greenhouse gas reduction options including non-CO2 gas abatement technologies. Multi-regional, multi-sectoral and multi-gas CGE model and simple climate change model simulated long-term climate stabilization emission path. Preliminary results showed that multi gas mitigation options including CH4 and N2O abatement technologies will reduce GDP loss more than CO2 only mitigation options for long-term climate stabilization, even though CO2 mitigation options will reduce not only CO2 emissions but non-CO2 gas emissions simultaneously. It is necessary to collect regional non-CO2 gas data (emission, technology options, and so on) and conduct more sensitivity analysis with computer simulation model to reduce uncertainty of non-CO2 gas.

  abstract = {Current carbon cycle models attribute rising atmospheric CO2 as the major driver of the increased terrestrial carbon sink, but with substantial uncertainties. The photosynthetic response of trees to elevated atmospheric CO2 is a necessary step, but not the only one, for sustaining the terrestrial carbon uptake, but can vary diurnally, seasonally and with duration of CO2 exposure. Hence, we sought to quantify the photosynthetic response of the canopy-dominant species, Quercus robur, in a mature deciduous forest to elevated CO2 (eCO2) (+150 {$\mu$}mol mol-1 CO2) over the first 3 years of a long-term free air CO2 enrichment facility at the Birmingham Institute of Forest Research in central England (BIFoR FACE). Over 3000 measurements of leaf gas exchange and related biochemical parameters were conducted in the upper canopy to assess the diurnal and seasonal responses of photosynthesis during the 2nd and 3rd year of eCO2 exposure. Measurements of photosynthetic capacity via biochemical parameters, derived from CO2 response curves, (Vcmax and Jmax) together with leaf nitrogen concentrations from the pre-treatment year to the 3rd year of eCO2 exposure, were examined. We hypothesized an initial enhancement in light-saturated net photosynthetic rates (Asat) with CO2 enrichment of {$\approx$}37\% based on theory but also expected photosynthetic capacity would fall over the duration of the study. Over the 3-year period, Asat of upper-canopy leaves was 33 {\textpm} 8\% higher (mean and standard error) in trees grown in eCO2 compared with ambient CO2 (aCO2), and photosynthetic enhancement decreased with decreasing light. There were no significant effects of CO2 treatment on Vcmax or Jmax, nor leaf nitrogen. Our results suggest that mature Q. robur may exhibit a sustained, positive response to eCO2 without photosynthetic downregulation, suggesting that, with adequate nutrients, there will be sustained enhancement in C assimilated by these mature trees. Further research will be required to understand the location and role of the additionally assimilated carbon.},

  abstract = {Earth's vegetation plays a pivotal role in the global water balance. Hence, there is a need to model dynamic interactions and feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the water cycle. Here, the hydrological performance of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ), a prominent dynamic global vegetation model, is evaluated. Models of this type simulate the coupled terrestrial carbon and water cycle, thus they are well suited for investigating biosphere-hydrosphere interactions over large domains. We demonstrate that runoff and evapotranspiration computed by LPJ agree well with respective results from state-of-the-art global hydrological models, while in some regions, runoff is significantly over- or underestimated compared to observations. The direction and magnitude of these biases is largely similar to those from other macro-scale models, rather than specific to LPJ. They are attributable primarily to uncertainties in the climate input data, and to human interventions not considered by the model (e.g. water withdrawal, land cover conversions). Additional model development is required to perform integrated assessments of water exchanges among the biosphere, the hydrosphere, and the anthroposphere. Yet, the LPJ model can now be used to study inter-relations between the world's major vegetation types and the terrestrial water balance. As an example, it is shown that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content alone would result in pronounced changes in evapotranspiration and runoff for many parts of the world. Although significant, these changes would remain unseen by stand-alone hydrological models, thereby emphasizing the importance of simulating the coupled carbon and water cycle. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Robust optimization is very useful for practice, since it is tailored to the information at hand, and it leads to computationally tractable formulations. It is therefore remarkable that real-life applications of robust optimization are still lagging behind; there is much more potential for real-life applications than has been exploited hitherto. The aim of this paper is to help practitioners to understand robust optimization and to successfully apply it in practice. We provide a brief introduction to robust optimization, and also describe important do's and don'ts for using it in practice. We use many small examples to illustrate our discussions.},

  abstract = {Land-use intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Alongside reductions in local species diversity, biotic homogenization at larger spatial scales is of great concern for conservation. Biotic homogenization means a decrease in {$\beta$}-diversity (the compositional dissimilarity between sites). Most studies have investigated losses in local ({$\alpha$})-diversity and neglected biodiversity loss at larger spatial scales. Studies addressing {$\beta$}-diversity have focused on single or a few organism groups (for example, ref. 4), and it is thus unknown whether land-use intensification homogenizes communities at different trophic levels, above- A nd belowground. Here we show that even moderate increases in local land-use intensity (LUI) cause biotic homogenization across microbial, plant and animal groups, both above- A nd belowground, and that this is largely independent of changes in {$\alpha$}-diversity. We analysed a unique grassland biodiversity dataset, with abundances of more than 4,000 species belonging to 12 trophic groups. LUI, and, in particular, high mowing intensity, had consistent effects on {$\beta$}-diversity across groups, causing a homogenization of soil microbial, fungal pathogen, plant and arthropod communities. These effects were nonlinear and the strongest declines in {$\beta$}-diversity occurred in the transition from extensively managed to intermediate intensity grassland. LUI tended to reduce local {$\alpha$}-diversity in aboveground groups, whereas the {$\alpha$}-diversity increased in belowground groups. Correlations between the {$\beta$}-diversity of different groups, particularly between plants and their consumers, became weaker at high LUI. This suggests a loss of specialist species and is further evidence for biotic homogenization. The consistently negative effects of LUI on landscape-scale biodiversity underscore the high value of extensively managed grasslands for conserving multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Indeed, biotic homogenization rather than local diversity loss could prove to be the most substantial consequence of land-use intensification.},

In the context of the Paris Climate Agreement, countries submitted their (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions ((I)NDCs), including climate mitigation targets. Assuming full implementation of (I)NDCs, we show that land use, and forests in particular, emerge as a key component of the Paris Agreement: turning globally from a net anthropogenic source during 1990-2010 (1.3 {\textpm} 1.1 GtCO2 e yr -1) to a net sink of carbon by 2030 (up to -1.1 {\textpm} 0.5 GtCO2 e yr -1), and providing a quarter of emission reductions planned by countries. Realizing and tracking this mitigation potential requires more transparency in countries' pledges and enhanced science-policy cooperation to increase confidence in numbers, including reconciling the 3 GtCO2e yr -1 difference in estimates between country reports and scientific studies.},

At present, there is a discrepancy of about 4 GtCO2 yr-1 in global anthropogenic net land-use emissions between global models (reflected in IPCC assessment reports) and aggregated national GHG inventories (under the UNFCCC). We show that a substantial part of this discrepancy (about 3.2 GtCO2 yr-1) can be explained by conceptual differences in anthropogenic forest sink estimation, related to the representation of environmental change impacts and the areas considered as managed. For a more credible tracking of collective progress under the Global stocktake, these conceptual differences between models and inventories need to be reconciled. We implement a new method of disaggregation of global land model results that allows greater comparability with GHG inventories. This provides a deeper understanding of model--inventory differences, allowing more transparent analysis of forest-based mitigation and facilitating a more accurate Global stocktake.},

  abstract = {Background: The credibility and effectiveness of country climate targets under the Paris Agreement requires that, in all greenhouse gas (GHG) sectors, the accounted mitigation outcomes reflect genuine deviations from the type and magnitude of activities generating emissions in the base year or baseline. This is challenging for the forestry sector, as the future net emissions can change irrespective of actual management activities, because of age-related stand dynamics resulting from past management and natural disturbances. The solution implemented under the Kyoto Protocol (2013--2020) was accounting mitigation as deviation from a projected (forward-looking) ``forest reference level'', which considered the age-related dynamics but also allowed including the assumed future implementation of approved policies. This caused controversies, as unverifiable counterfactual scenarios with inflated future harvest could lead to credits where no change in management has actually occurred, or conversely, failing to reflect in the accounts a policy-driven increase in net emissions. Instead, here we describe an approach to set reference levels based on the projected continuation of documented historical forest management practice, i.e. reflecting age-related dynamics but not the future impact of policies. We illustrate a possible method to implement this approach at the level of the European Union (EU) using the Carbon Budget Model. Results: Using EU country data, we show that forest sinks between 2013 and 2016 were greater than that assumed in the 2013--2020 EU reference level under the Kyoto Protocol, which would lead to credits of 110--120 Mt CO2/year (capped at 70--80 Mt CO2/year, equivalent to 1.3\% of 1990 EU total emissions). By modelling the continuation of management practice documented historically (2000--2009), we show that these credits are mostly due to the inclusion in the reference levels of policy-assumed harvest increases that never materialized. With our proposed approach, harvest is expected to increase (12\% in 2030 at EU-level, relative to 2000--2009), but more slowly than in current forest reference levels, and only because of age-related dynamics, i.e. increased growing stocks in maturing forests. Conclusions: Our science-based approach, compatible with the EU post-2020 climate legislation, helps to ensure that only genuine deviations from the continuation of historically documented forest management practices are accounted toward climate targets, therefore enhancing the consistency and comparability across GHG sectors. It provides flexibility for countries to increase harvest in future reference levels when justified by age-related dynamics. It offers a policy-neutral solution to the polarized debate on forest accounting (especially on bioenergy) and supports the credibility of forest sector mitigation under the Paris Agreement.},

(Nature 562:259-262, 2018) analyses the climate impact of forest management in the European Union, considering both biogeochemical (i.e., greenhouse gases, GHG) and biophysical (e.g., albedo, transpiration, etc.) effects. Based on their findings, i.e. that additional net overall climate benefits from forest management would be modest, the authors conclude that the EU "should not rely on forest management to mitigate climate change". We first explain that most of the additional EU GHG mitigation effort by 2030 is expected to come from emission reductions and only a very small part from forestry, even when forest bioenergy is allowed for. Nevertheless, the inclusion of forest management in climate change mitigation strategies is key to identifying the country-specific optimal mix, in terms of overall GHG balance, between strategies focused on conserving and/or enhancing the sink and strategies focused on using more wood to reduce emissions in other GHG sectors. Then, while acknowledging the importance that biophysical effects have on the climate, especially at the local and seasonal scale, we argue that the net annual biophysical climate impact of forest management in Europe remains more uncertain than the net CO2 impact. This has not been adequately emphasized by Luyssaert et al. (2018), leading to conclusions on the net overall climate impact of forest management that we consider premature and applied to a partially biased perception of European policy towards forestry and climate change. To avoid further confusion in the debate on how forestry may contribute to mitigating climate change, a more constructive dialogue between the scientific community and policy makers is needed.},

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} Forests mitigate climate change by reducing atmospheric CO2-concentrations through the carbon sink in the forest and in wood products, and substitution effects when wood products replace carbon-intensive materials and fuels. Quantifying the carbon mitigation potential of forests is highly challenging due to the influence of multiple important factors such as forest age and type, climate change and associated natural disturbances, harvest intensities, wood usage patterns, salvage logging practices, and the carbon-intensity of substituted products. Here, we developed a framework to quantify the impact of these factors through factorial simulation experiments with an ecosystem model at the example of central European (Bavarian) forests. Results{\enspace} Our simulations showed higher mitigation potentials of young forests compared to mature forests, and similar ones in broad-leaved and needle-leaved forests. Long-lived wood products significantly contributed to mitigation, particularly in needle-leaved forests due to their wood product portfolio, and increased material usage of wood showed considerable climate benefits. Consequently, the ongoing conversion of needle-leaved to more broad-leaved forests should be accompanied by the promotion of long-lived products from broad-leaved species to maintain the product sink. Climate change (especially increasing disturbances) and decarbonization were among the most critical factors influencing mitigation potentials and introduced substantial uncertainty. Nevertheless, until 2050 this uncertainty was narrow enough to derive robust findings. For instance, reducing harvest intensities enhanced the carbon sink in our simulations, but diminished substitution effects, leading to a decreased total mitigation potential until 2050. However, when considering longer time horizons (i.e. until 2100), substitution effects became low enough in our simulations due to expected decarbonization such that decreasing harvests often seemed the more favorable solution. Conclusion{\enspace} Our results underscore the need to tailor mitigation strategies to the specific conditions of different forest sites. Furthermore, considering substitution effects, and thoroughly assessing the amount of avoided emissions by using wood products, is critical to determine mitigation potentials. While short-term recommendations are possible, we suggest risk diversification and methodologies like robust optimization to address increasing uncertainties from climate change and decarbonization paces past 2050. Finally, curbing emissions reduces the threat of climate change on forests, safeguarding their carbon sink and ecosystem services.},

To address this, we identify and quantify ``natural climate solutions'' (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS---when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation---is 23.8 petagrams of CO2 equivalent (PgCO2e) y-1 (95\% CI 20.3--37.4). This is {$\geq$}30\% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO2e y-1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is {$\geq$}100 USD MgCO2e-1 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37\% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a {$>$}66\% chance of holding warming to below 2 {$^\circ$}C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2-1. Most NCS actions---if effectively implemented---also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.},

  abstract = {Consider a multiobjective decision problem with uncertainty in the objective functions, given as a set of scenarios. In the single-criterion case, robust optimization methodology helps to identify solutions which remain feasible and of good quality for all possible scenarios. A well-known alternative method in the single-objective case is to compare possible decisions under uncertainty with the optimal decision with the benefit of hindsight, i.e. to minimize the (possibly scaled) regret of not having chosen the optimal decision. In this contribution, we extend the concept of regret from the single-objective case to the multiobjective setting and introduce a proper definition of multivariate (robust) (relative) regret. In contrast to the few existing ideas that mix scalarization and optimization, we clearly separate the modelling of multiobjective (robust) regret from its numerical solution. Moreover, our approach is not limited to a finite uncertainty set or interval uncertainty and furthermore, computations or at least approximations remain tractable in several important special cases. We illustrate all approaches based on a biobjective shortest path problem under uncertainty.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Recent decades have been characterized by increasing temperatures worldwide, resulting in an exponential climb in vapor pressure deficit (\emph{VPD}). \emph{VPD} has been identified as an increasingly important driver of plant functioning in terrestrial biomes including being a major contributor in recent drought-induced plant mortality, independently from other drivers associated with climate change. Despite this, few studies have isolated the physiological response of plant functioning to high \emph{VPD}, thus limiting our understanding and ability to predict future impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. An abundance of evidence suggests that stomatal conductance declines under high \emph{VPD} and transpiration increases in most species up until a given \emph{VPD} threshold, leading to a cascade of subsequent impacts including reduced photosynthesis and growth, and higher risks of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure Incorporation of photosynthetic and hydraulic traits in 'next-generation' land-surface models has the greatest potential for improved prediction of \emph{VPD} responses at the plant- and global-scale, and will yield more mechanistic simulations of plant responses to a changing climate. By providing a fully integrated framework and evaluation of the impacts of high \emph{VPD} on plant function, improvements in forecasting and long-term projections of climate impacts can be made.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this review, consistent mechanisms are identified by which tree diversity could reduce vulnerability to drought and emerging evidence is revealed that tree diversity is not systematically positively related to drought resistance in forests.

Essential to meeting this challenge is the incorporation of natural capital and the ecosystem services it provides into decision-making. We explore progress and crucial gaps at this frontier, reflecting upon the 10 y since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. We focus on three key dimensions of progress and ongoing challenges: raising awareness of the interdependence of ecosystems and human well-being, advancing the fundamental interdisciplinary science of ecosystem services, and implementing this science in decisions to restore natural capital and use it sustainably. Awareness of human dependence on nature is at an all-time high, the science of ecosystem services is rapidly advancing, and talk of natural capital is now common from governments to corporate boardrooms. However, successful implementation is still in early stages. We explore why ecosystem service information has yet to fundamentally change decision-making and suggest a path forward that emphasizes: (i) developing solid evidence linking decisions to impacts on natural capital and ecosystem services, and then to human well-being; (ii) working closely with leaders in government, business, and civil society to develop the knowledge, tools, and practices necessary to integrate natural capital and ecosystem services into everyday decision-making; and (iii) reforming institutions to change policy and practices to better align private short-term goals with societal long-term goals.},

We used a new data set for tropical humid forests and a standardized evaluation approach (based on pixel matching) to quantify the performance of a representative sample of 40 voluntary REDD+ projects in 9 countries certified under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). In the first 5 years of implementation, deforestation within project areas was reduced by 47\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 24--68) compared with matched counterfactual pixels, and degradation rates were 58\% lower (95\% CI: 49--63). Reductions were small in absolute terms but greater in sites located in high-deforestation settings and did not appear to be substantially undermined by leakage activities in forested areas within 10~km of project boundaries. At the 26th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the international community renewed its commitment to tackling tropical deforestation as a nature-based solution to climate change. Our results indicate that incentivizing forest conservation through voluntary site-based projects can slow tropical deforestation and highlight the particular importance of prioritizing financing for areas at greater risk of deforestation.},

  abstract = {Old-growth forests remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at rates that vary with climate and nitrogen deposition. The sequestered carbon dioxide is stored in live woody tissues and slowly decomposing organic matter in litter and soil. Old-growth forests therefore serve as a global carbon dioxide sink, but they are not protected by international treaties, because it is generally thought that ageing forests cease to accumulate carbon. Here we report a search of literature and databases for forest carbon-flux estimates. We find that in forests between 15 and 800 years of age, net ecosystem productivity (the net carbon balance of the forest including soils) is usually positive. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forests can continue to accumulate carbon, contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral. Over 30 per cent of the global forest area is unmanaged primary forest, and this area contains the remaining old-growth forests. Half of the primary forests (6 {\texttimes} 10 8 hectares) are located in the boreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. On the basis of our analysis, these forests alone sequester about 1.3 {\textpm} 0.5 gigatonnes of carbon per year. Thus, our findings suggest that 15 per cent of the global forest area, which is currently not considered when offsetting increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, provides at least 10 per cent of the global net ecosystem productivity. Old-growth forests accumulate carbon for centuries and contain large quantities of it. We expect, however, that much of this carbon, even soil carbon, will move back to the atmosphere if these forests are disturbed. {\copyright}2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Forests can help mitigate climate change in different ways, such as by storing carbon in forest ecosystems, and by producing a renewable supply of material and energy products. We analyse the climate implications of different scenarios for forestry, bioenergy and wood construction. We consider three main forestry scenarios for Kronoberg County in Sweden, over a 201-year period. The Business-as-usual scenario mirrors today's forestry while in the Production scenario the forest productivity is increased by 40\% through more intensive forestry. In the Set-aside scenario 50\% of forest land is set-aside for conservation. The Production scenario results in less net carbon dioxide emissions and cumulative radiative forcing compared to the other scenarios, after an initial period of 30--35 years during which the Set-aside scenario has less emissions. In the end of the analysed period, the Production scenario yields strong emission reductions, about ten times greater than the initial reduction in the Set-aside scenario. Also, the Set-aside scenario has higher emissions than Business-as-usual after about 80 years. Increasing the harvest level of slash and stumps results in climate benefits, due to replacement of more fossil fuel. Greatest emission reduction is achieved when biomass replaces coal, and when modular timber buildings are used. In the long run, active forestry with high harvest and efficient utilisation of biomass for replacement of carbon-intensive non-wood products and fuels provides significant climate mitigation, in contrast to setting aside forest land to store more carbon in the forest and reduce the harvest of biomass.},

Management plans frequently seek to change the structure of a landscape to realise particular management goals, because it is recognized that the spatial arrangement of elements in a land cover mosaic control the ecological processes which operate within it. This study reviews some of the tools available to those who need to describe and understand the spatial structure of landscapes. In particular, it examines the way in which quantitative measures, or indices, can be used and what contribution they might make to the management of forested landscapes in the UK. The paper discusses the way in which the different landscape indices can be used to assess the spatial implications of the various design guidelines that have been proposd to promote sustainable forms of forestry. It is concluded that while progress has been made in the development of a range of landscape pattern measures, and in our understanding of the factors constraining their use, there is a pressing need for further research into the relationship between landscape pattern and ecological process.},

No reuse allowed without permission. An extreme summer drought caused unprecedented tree dieback across Central Europe in 2018, highlighting the need for a better mechanistic understanding of drought-induced tree mortality. While numerous physiological risk factors have been identified, the principal mechanisms, hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, are still debated. We studied 9,435 trees from 12 temperate species planted in a diversity experiment in 2013 to assess how hydraulic traits, carbon dynamics, pest infestation, tree height and neighbourhood competition influence individual mortality risk. We observed a reduced mortality risk for trees with wider hydraulic safety margins, while a rising sugar fraction of the non-structural carbohydrate pool and bark beetle infestation were associated with higher risk. Taller trees had a lower mortality risk. The sign and magnitude of neighbourhood effects on mortality risk depended on the species-identity of the involved trees, with most species having beneficial and some having deleterious effects on their neighbours. While severe tissue dehydration causing hydraulic failure precedes drought-induced tree mortality, we show that the probability of this event depends on a series of mutually inclusive processes including pest infestation and starch depletion for osmotic adjustment, and is modulated by the size and species identity of a tree and its neighbours.},

The relationship between the productivity and conservational value of a site is poorly known; however, it has been hypothesized that biodiversity increases with productivity due to higher resource abundance or heterogeneity, and that the species communities of low-productivity land are a nested subset of communities from more productive land. We tested these hypotheses for dead-wood-dependent beetles by comparing their species richness and composition, as well as the amount and diversity of dead wood, between low-productivity (potential forest growth {$<$}1 m 3 {$\cdot$}ha -1 {$\cdot$}yr -1 ) and high-productivity Scots pine-dominated stands in Sweden. We included four stand types: stands situated on (1) thin soils and (2) mires (both low-productivity), (3) managed stands, and (4) unmanaged stands set aside for conservation purposes (both high-productivity). Beetle species richness and number of red-listed species were highest in the high-productivity set-asides. Species richness was positively correlated with the volume and diversity of dead wood, but volume appeared to be a better predictor than diversity for the higher species richness in set-asides. Beetle species composition was similar among stand types, and the assemblages in low-productivity stands were largely subsets of those in high-productivity set-asides. However, 11\% of all species and 40\% of red-listed species only occurred in high-productivity stands, while no species were unique to low-productivity stands. We conclude that low-productivity forests are less valuable for conservation than high-productivity forest land. Given the generally similar species composition among stand types, a comparable conservational effect could be obtained by setting aside a larger area of low-productivity forest in comparison to the high-productivity. In terms of dead wood volumes, 1.8--3.6 ha of low-productivity forest has the same value as 1 ha of unmanaged high-productivity forest. This figure can be used to estimate the conservation value of low-productivity forests; however, as high-productivity forests harbored some unique species, they are not completely exchangeable.},

This omission limits the validity of their findings and may undermine the `science-based' decisions they inform. We summarize and analyze seven commonly perceived challenges to conducting uncertainty assessment that help explain why it often receives superficial treatment in ES studies. We connect these challenges to solutions in relevant scientific literature and guidance documents. Since ES science is based on a multiplicity of disciplines (e.g. ecology, hydrology, economics, environmental modeling, policy sciences), substantial knowledge already exists to identify, quantify, and communicate uncertainties. The integration of these disciplines for solution-oriented modeling has been the focus of the integrated assessment community for many years, and we argue that many insights and best practices from this field can be directly used to improve ES assessments. We also recognize a number of issues that hinder the adoption of uncertainty assessment as part of standard practice. Our synthesis provides a starting point for ES analysts and other applied modelers looking for further guidance on uncertainty assessment and helps scientists and decision-makers to set reasonable expectations for characterizing the level of confidence associated with an ES assessment.},

We found a lethal threshold at 80\% loss of hydraulic conductivity -- a point of hydraulic failure beyond which it is more likely trees will die, than survive, and describe mortality risk across all levels of water stress. Foliar color changes lagged behind hydraulic failure -- best predicting when trees had been dead for some time, rather than when they were dying. Our direct measurement of native conductivity, while monitoring the same individuals for survival or mortality, quantifies a continuous probability of mortality risk from hydraulic failure. Predicting tree die-off events and understanding the mechanism involved requires knowledge not only of when trees are dead, but when they begin dying -- having passed the point of no return.},

But despite the vital importance of forests to global ecosystem services, their fates in a warming world remain highly uncertain. Lacking is quantitative determination of commonality in climate anomalies associated with pulses of tree mortality---from published, field-documented mortality events---required for understanding the role of extreme climate events in overall global tree die-off patterns. Here we established a geo-referenced global database documenting climate-induced mortality events spanning all tree-supporting biomes and continents, from 154 peer-reviewed studies since 1970. Our analysis quantifies a global ``hotter-drought fingerprint'' from these tree-mortality sites---effectively a hotter and drier climate signal for tree mortality---across 675 locations encompassing 1,303 plots. Frequency of these observed mortality-year climate conditions strongly increases nonlinearly under projected warming. Our database also provides initial footing for further community-developed, quantitative, ground-based monitoring of global tree mortality.},

Climate change is expected to strongly affect tree species distribution within these forests2,3. Climate and land use are undergoing rapid changes at present4, with initial range shifts already visible5. However, discussions on the consequences of biome shifts have concentrated on ecological issues6. Here we show that forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation may have severe economic consequences. On the basis of our model results, the expected value of European forest land will decrease owing to the decline of economically valuable species in the absence of effective countermeasures. We found that by 2100 - depending on the interest rate and climate scenario applied - this loss varies between 14 and 50\% (mean: 28\% for an interest rate of 2\%) of the present value of forest land in Europe, excluding Russia, and may total several hundred billion Euros. Our model shows that - depending on different realizations of three climate scenarios - by 2100, between 21 and 60\% (mean: 34\%) of European forest lands will be suitable only for a Mediterranean oak forest type with low economic returns for forest owners and the timber industry and reduced carbon sequestration.

Climate change could therefore result in species range dynamics that reduce the relevance of current fixed protected areas in future conservation strategies. Here, we apply species distribution modeling and conservation planning tools in three regions (Mexico, the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, and Western Europe) to examine the need for addi- tional protected areas in light of anticipated species range shifts caused by climate change. We set species repre- sentation targets and assessed the area required to meet those targets in the present and in the future, under a moderate climate change scenario. Our findings indicate that protected areas can be an important conservation strategy in such a scenario, and that early action may be both more effective and less costly than inaction or delayed action. According to our projections, costs may vary among regions and none of the three areas studied will fully meet all conservation targets, even under a moderate climate change scenario. This suggests that lim- iting climate change is an essential complement to adding protected areas for conservation of biodiversity.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms.

Negative feedback will reduce the impact of an external perturbation, a positive feedback will amplify the effect and could lead to an unstable system. Many of the feedbacks found in the climate system are positive; thus, for example, increasing CO2 levels will increase temperature, reduce the snow cover, increase the absorption of radiation and hence increase temperature further. The most obvious feedbacks, such as the snow example quoted above, are already included within our models of the climate and earth system. Others, such as the impact of increasing forest cover due to global warming, are only just being included. Others, such as, the impact of global warming on the northern peatlands and the impact of freshwater flows on the Arctic Ocean are not yet considered. The contrast in surface characteristics between low tundra vegetation to high taiga forest is considerable. The contrast is greatest in the winter, when the tundra is snow covered but the trees of the taiga protrude through the snow pack, and is probably the greatest contrast found on the land surface anywhere. This variation causes massive changes in the energy fluxes at the surface and hence the temperature conditions on the ground and within the atmosphere. There will be large resultant changes in the vegetation development, the carbon fluxes, the permafrost and the hydrology. The Arctic is already experiencing change and it is essential for us to understand the basic processes, and how these interact, to be confident of our predictions of environmental change in the future.},

Are these predictions - at the population, community and ecosystem level - consistent with long-term measurements in permanent plots? Location: Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco dominated forest in western Oregon, US. Methods: Over a 100-yr period, measurements every 5-10 yrs of the growth, mortality and regeneration of individually tagged trees in three 0.4-ha forest plots dominated by P. menziesii were used to test predictions derived from chronosequence studies. Results: Population- and community-level predictions generally matched observations: the initial cohort of pioneer species declined exponentially, with the shorter-lived Prunus emarginata (Douglas ex Hook.) Eaton and Arbutus menziesii Pursh disappearing altogether, and long-lived species such as P. menziesii persisting; tree size distribution shifted from a log-normal to a normal distribution, although the establishment of mid- to late-seral species created a bimodal distribution that may represent a transitional phase not usually elaborated in prior work; and mortality shifted from largely density-dependent to increasing amounts of density-independent causes. The observed biomass composition of these forests, even after 154 yrs, was still largely dominated by P. menziesii, which was consistent with the prediction from chronosequence studies. The slowing of biomass accumulation as stands aged predicted from ecosystem theory was not consistent with the observation that live biomass accumulated at a relatively constant rate for the 100-yr period. Conclusion: Predictions from chronosequences at the population and community level were consistent with long-term observations in permanent plots, whereas those at the ecosystem level were not. At the spatial scale ({$<$}2 ha) examined with these plots, the high heterogeneity of tree mortality may lead to a multi-modal pattern of net live biomass accumulation with long periods of constant gain interrupted by sudden losses of live biomass.},

Regrowth following harvest of the planted stands provided the coppice treatment, harvested at 6, 12, and 18 months. Allometry of woody biomass and leaf are did not differ between planted and coppice treatments in any of the four species. Coppice stands had a higher population density than original planted stands, due to production of multiple stems per stump following cutting. Competition began sooner in coppice stands, resulting in smaller shoots than in planted stands of the same age. Mean monthly increment peaked earlier in coppice than in planted stands, but maximum mean monthly increment and leaf area index at culmination were not consistently higher in either treatment. Management of coppice stands for maximum biomass production would require earlier harvesting of smaller stems, thereby having a greater proportion of leaf biomass. If larger stems or lower leaf biomass ratios are preferred, coppice stands should be thinned to the same population densities as planted stands. {\copyright} 1993.},

The YAFO package consists of an optimization module, that has been programmed using the modelling software AIMMS. In addition, it contains two Excel-based spreadsheet files - an import and evaluation module and a risk analysis module. The YAFO model calculates financially optimized management scenarios by means of the net present value development of single stands. Optionally, the objective function can also consider risks and uncertainties due to natural calamities and timber price fluctuations, using the value at risk approach or risk utility functions. Nonlinear programming algorithms are used as solution techniques. As YAFO provides the additional flexibility to switch between two timber grading options on stand level, effects of timber price scenarios on grading can be analyzed. Due to its modular design, it can be easily adopted to individual data bases. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Surface processes also play an important role in determining the overall energy balance of the planet. The energy budget at the surface is more complex than the budget at the top of the atmosphere because it requires consideration of fluxes of energy by conduction and by convection of heat and moisture through fluid motion, as well as by radiation. The local surface-energy budget depends on the insolation, the surface characteristics---such as wetness, vegetative cover, and albedo---and on the characteristics of the overlying atmosphere. The energy budget of the surface is intimately related to the hydrologic cycle, as evaporation from the surface is a key component in the budgets of both energy and water. Understanding the energy budget of the surface is a necessary part of understanding climate and its dependence on external constraints.},

At present, timber construction is limited almost exclusively to softwoods.

August 2014 saw the launch of the first industrially manufactured construction material derived from hardwood - BauBuche, a laminated veneer lumber produced from European beech. This new material has an exceptionally high load-bearing capacity, and therefore permits more slender structural components and longer spans in timber construction. Compared with softwoods, BauBuche reduces material consumption considerably, while a comparison with steel shows that BauBuche has the potential to open up completely new applications for timber construction. BauBuche has national technical approval and conforms to the Eurocode 5 rules for the design of timber structures. The high strength and density, however, mean that special rules apply for certain individual aspects.},

  abstract = {Several lines of evidence point to an increase in the activity of the terrestrial biosphere over recent decades, impacting the global net land carbon sink (NLS) and its control on the growth of atmospheric carbon dioxide (ca). Global terrestrial gross primary production (GPP)---the rate of carbon fixation by photosynthesis---is estimated to have risen by (31 {\textpm} 5)\% since 1900, but the relative contributions of different putative drivers to this increase are not well known. Here we identify the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration as the dominant driver. We reconcile leaf-level and global atmospheric constraints on trends in modeled biospheric activity to reveal a global CO2 fertilization effect on photosynthesis of 30\% since 1900, or 47\% for a doubling of ca above the pre-industrial level. Our historic value is nearly twice as high as current estimates (17 {\textpm} 4)\% that do not use the full range of available constraints. Consequently, under a future low-emission scenario, we project a land carbon sink (174 PgC, 2006--2099) that is 57 PgC larger than if a lower CO2 fertilization effect comparable with current estimates is assumed. These findings suggest a larger beneficial role of the land carbon sink in modulating future excess anthropogenic CO2 consistent with the target of the Paris Agreement to stay below 2{$^\circ$}C warming, and underscore the importance of preserving terrestrial carbon sinks.},

The importance of these symbiotic fungi for plant nutrition is well established. However, the role of mycorrhizal fungi in transporting carbon into soil systems on a global scale remains under-explored. This is surprising given that {$\sim$}75\% of terrestrial carbon is stored belowground and mycorrhizal fungi are stationed at a key entry point of carbon into soil food webs. Here, we analyze nearly 200 datasets to provide the first global quantitative estimates of carbon allocation from plants to the mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi. We estimate that global plant communities allocate 3.93 Gt CO2e per year to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, 9.07 Gt CO2e per year to ectomycorrhizal fungi, and 0.12 Gt CO2e per year to ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. Based on this estimate, 13.12 Gt of CO2e fixed by terrestrial plants is, at least temporarily, allocated to the underground mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi per year, equating to {$\sim$}36\% of current annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. We explore the mechanisms by which mycorrhizal fungi affect soil carbon pools and identify approaches to increase our understanding of global carbon fluxes via plant--fungal pathways. Our estimates, although based on the best available evidence, are imperfect and should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, our estimations are conservative, and we argue that this work confirms the significant contribution made by mycorrhizal associations to global carbon dynamics. Our findings should motivate their inclusion both within global climate and carbon cycling models, and within conservation policy and practice.},

Furthermore, the possibility that breeding material colonized by P. chalcographus may induce subsequent attacks by I. typographus on nearby trees was also studied. The tree killing ability of P. chalcographus was low as only 8\% of the baited trees, attacked by P. chalcographus alone, were killed. Tree death was strongly related to the presence of I. typographus, which is in line with the association with aggressive wood-living fungi in this species. The reproductive success was low, with on average less than one daughter beetle produced per mother beetle. The success was significantly higher in trees also inhabited by I. typographus.

  abstract = {Potential natural vegetation (PNV) is the vegetation cover in equilibrium with climate, that would exist at a given location if not impacted by human activities. PNV is useful for raising public awareness about land degradation and for estimating land potential. This paper presents results of assessing machine learning algorithms-neural networks (nnet package), random forest (ranger), gradient boosting (gbm), K-nearest neighborhood (class) and Cubist-for operational mapping of PNV. Three case studies were considered: (1) global distribution of biomes based on the BIOME 6000 data set (8,057 modern pollen-based site reconstructions), (2) distribution of forest tree taxa in Europe based on detailed occurrence records (1,546,435 ground observations), and (3) global monthly fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) values (30,301 randomly-sampled points). A stack of 160 global maps representing biophysical conditions over land, including atmospheric, climatic, relief, and lithologic variables, were used as explanatory variables. The overall results indicate that random forest gives the overall best performance. The highest accuracy for predicting BIOME 6000 classes (20) was estimated to be between 33\% (with spatial cross-validation) and 68\% (simple random sub-setting), with the most important predictors being total annual precipitation, monthly temperatures, and bioclimatic layers. Predicting forest tree species (73) resulted in mapping accuracy of 25\%, with the most important predictors being monthly cloud fraction, mean annual and monthly temperatures, and elevation. Regression models for FAPAR (monthly images) gave an R-square of 90\% with the most important predictors being total annual precipitation, monthly cloud fraction, CHELSA bioclimatic layers, and month of the year, respectively. Further developments of PNV mapping could include using all GBIF records to map the global distribution of plant species at different taxonomic levels. This methodology could also be extended to dynamic modeling of PNV, so that future climate scenarios can be incorporated. Global maps of biomes, FAPAR and tree species at one km spatial resolution are available for download via http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QQHCIK.},

A global application of the model suggests that the response found in the experiments might also be representative of the average response of forests globally.

Nowadays, interest in timber cladding is again increasing because of ecological reasons as well as naturalistic viewpoints. This review presents a comprehensive report on timber cladding in a European context, beginning with a brief overview of the history before considering contemporary use of timber cladding for building envelopes. The basic principles of good design are considered, paying attention to timber orientation, fixings and environmental risk factors. The relationship of timber with moisture is discussed with respect to sorption behaviour, dimensional instability and design methods to minimise the negative consequences associated with wetting. The behaviour of timber cladding in fires, the effects of environmental stresses and weathering, as well as the cladding properties and the variation thereof with different types of wood and anatomical factors (including exposure of different timber faces), are examined. The review then moves on to considering different methods for protecting timber, such as the use of coatings, preservatives, fire retardants and wood modification. A brief discussion of various environmental considerations is also included, including life cycle assessment, embodied carbon and sequestered atmospheric carbon. The review finishes by making concluding remarks, providing a basis for the selection of appropriate cladding types for different environments.},

  abstract = {The successional dynamics of forests---from canopy openings to regeneration, maturation, and decay---influence the amount and heterogeneity of resources available for forest-dwelling organisms. Conservation has largely focused only on selected stages of forest succession (e.g., late-seral stages). However, to develop comprehensive conservation strategies and to understand the impact of forest management on biodiversity, a quantitative understanding of how different trophic groups vary over the course of succession is needed. We classified mixed mountain forests in Central Europe into nine successional stages using airborne LiDAR. We analysed {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-diversity of six trophic groups encompassing approximately 3,000 species from three kingdoms. We quantified the effect of successional stage on the number of species with and without controlling for species abundances and tested whether the data fit the more-individuals hypothesis or the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Furthermore, we analysed the similarity of assemblages along successional development. The abundance of producers, first-order consumers, and saprotrophic species showed a U-shaped response to forest succession. The number of species of producer and consumer groups generally followed this U-shaped pattern. In contrast to our expectation, the number of saprotrophic species did not change along succession. When we controlled for the effect of abundance, the number of producer and saproxylic beetle species increased linearly with forest succession, whereas the U-shaped response of the number of consumer species persisted. The analysis of assemblages indicated a large contribution of succession-mediated {$\beta$}-diversity to regional {$\gamma$}-diversity. Synthesis and applications. Depending on the species group, our data supported both the more-individuals hypothesis and the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Our results highlight the strong influence of forest succession on biodiversity and underline the importance of controlling for successional dynamics when assessing biodiversity change in response to external drivers such as climate change. The successional stages with highest diversity (early and late successional stages) are currently strongly underrepresented in the forests of Central Europe. We thus recommend that conservation strategies aim at a more balanced representation of all successional stages.},

  abstract = {Climate change will alter the site conditions for European vegetation. This is likely to shift the potential distribution of species and habitats outside its current boundaries. To enable future projections on shifts in vegetation potentials, we fitted a multiclass model to the current potential natural vegetation (PNV) of Europe using climatic predictors. The model was then applied to climate data of the time slice 2061--2080 with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and RCP 8.5. With an accuracy of 0.78, simulations well represented the site-equivalent vegetation types of the current PNV across Europe. Projections show drastic shifts in vegetation potentials in all parts of Europe. Boreal forests could lose up to 75\% of their current potential, while Mediterranean Quercus forests and steppes would double their potential area. Deserts are projected to be on the rice, and the potential of currently widespread vegetation such as Fagus forests would be translocated. These estimated alterations of European vegetation potentials could have great effects on the stability of current forests, affecting nature conservation strategies and forest management.},

So far, evidence for this idea has remained elusive, and integrated climate models assume smooth vegetation responses. We analyzed data on the distribution of tree cover in Africa, Australia, and South America to reveal strong evidence for the existence of three distinct attractors: forest, savanna, and a treeless state. Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation. These results allow the identification of regions where forest or savanna may most easily tip into an alternative state, and they pave the way to a new generation of coupled climate models.},

Here we use harmonized climate and land-use projections to investigate their potential combined impacts on global vertebrate diversity under a low- and a high-level emission scenario. We combine climate-based species distribution models for the world's amphibians, birds, and mammals with land-use change simulations and identify areas threatened by both climate and land-use change in the future. The combined projected effects of climate and land-use change on vertebrate diversity are similar under the two scenarios, with land-use change effects being stronger under the low- and climate change effects under the high-emission scenario. Under the low-emission scenario, increases in bioenergy cropland may cause severe impacts in biodiversity that are not compensated by lower climate change impacts. Under this low-emission scenario, larger proportions of species distributions and a higher number of small-range species may become impacted by the combination of land-use and climate change than under the high-emission scenario, largely a result of bioenergy cropland expansion. Our findings highlight the need to carefully consider both climate and land-use change when projecting biodiversity impacts. We show that biodiversity is likely to suffer severely if bioenergy cropland expansion remains a major component of climate change mitigation strategies. Our study calls for an immediate and significant reduction in energy consumption for the benefit of both biodiversity and to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Anthropogenic land use and land cover change (LULCC) is a major driver of environmental changes. The biophysical impacts of these changes on the regional climate in Europe are currently being extensively investigated within the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) Coordinated Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Flagship Pilot Study (FPS) Land Use and Climate Across Scales (LUCAS) using an ensemble of different regional climate models (RCMs) coupled with diverse land surface models (LSMs). In order to investigate the impact of realistic LULCC on past and future climates, high-resolution datasets with observed LULCC and projected future LULCC scenarios are required as input for the RCM--LSM simulations. To account for these needs, we generated the LUCAS Land Use and land Cover change (LUC) dataset version 1.1 at 0.1{$\circ$} resolution for Europe with annual LULC maps from 1950 to 2100 (https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/LUC\_hist\_EU\_v1.1, Hoffmann et al., 2022b, https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/LUC\_future\_EU\_v1.1, Hoffmann et al., 2022a), which is tailored to use in state-of-the-art RCMs. The plant functional type (PFT) distribution for the year 2015 (i.e. the Modelling human LAND surface Modifications and its feedbacks on local and regional cliMATE -- LANDMATE -- PFT dataset) is derived from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (ESA-CCI LC) dataset. Details on the conversion method, cross-walking procedure, and evaluation of the LANDMATE PFT dataset are given in the companion paper by Reinhart et al. (2022b). Subsequently, we applied the land use change information from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) dataset, provided at 0.25{$\circ$} resolution as input for Coupled Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments, to derive LULC distributions at high spatial resolution and at annual time steps from 1950 to 2100. In order to convert land use and land management change information from LUH2 into changes in the PFT distribution, we developed a land use translator (LUT) specific to the needs of RCMs. The annual PFT maps for Europe for the period 1950 to 2015 are derived from the historical LUH2 dataset by applying the LUT backward from 2015 to 1950. Historical changes in the forest type changes are considered using an additional European forest species dataset. The historical changes in the PFT distribution of LUCAS LUC follow closely the land use changes given by LUH2 but differ in some regions compared to other annual LULCC datasets. From 2016 onward, annual PFT maps for future land use change scenarios based on LUH2 are derived for different shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) and representative concentration pathway (RCP) combinations used in the framework of CMIP6. The resulting LULCC maps can be applied as land use forcing to the new generation of RCM simulations for downscaling of CMIP6 results. The newly developed LUT is transferable to other CORDEX regions worldwide.},

A question is therefore whether timber taken from the vast boreal forests on an increasing scale should serve as a source of wood-based biofuels and whether this will be effective climate policy. In a typical boreal forest, it takes 70-120 years before a stand of trees is mature. When this time lag and the dynamics of boreal forests more generally are taken into account, it follows that a high level of harvest means that the carbon stock in the forest stabilizes at a lower level. Therefore, wood harvesting is not a carbon-neutral activity. Through model simulations, it is estimated that an increased harvest of a boreal forest will create a biofuel carbon debt that takes 190-340 years to repay. The length of the payback time is sensitive to the type of fossil fuels that wood energy replaces {\copyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Although these studies agreed in their estimates of forest productivity, their conclusions were contradictory. This study tested the effect of four assumptions by which those papers differed. These assumptions regard (1) whether a single or a set of repeated harvests were considered, (2) at what stage in stand growth harvest takes place, (3) how the baseline is constructed, and (4) whether a carbon-cycle model is applied. A main finding was that current and future increase in the use of bioenergy should be studied considering a series of repeated harvests. Moreover, the time of harvest should be determined based on economical principles, thus taking place before stand growth culminates, which has implications for the design of the baseline scenario. When the most realistic assumptions are used and a carbon-cycle model is applied, an increased harvest level in forests leads to a permanent increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. {\copyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

However, it is the ability to make meaningful predictions about the rapidly changing future that is questioned. What appears to be particularly neglected is the question of the length of time horizons and the limits (if any) to these horizons, despite being considered one of the most critical factors in strategic planning. As the future creation of values lies within individual responsibility, this research empirically explored the limits (if any) of individual foresters' time horizons. To draw comparisons between countries with different traditions in forest management planning, data were collected through telephone surveys of forest managers in the state/national forest services of the Netherlands and Germany. In order to minimize other cultural differences, the research in Germany concentrated on the federal state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, which has considerable similarities with the Netherlands, e.g. in topography, forest types and forest functions. The results show that, in practice, 15 years appears to be the most distant horizon that foresters can identify with. This is in sharp contrast to the time horizons spanning decades and even generations that are always said to exist in forestry. The "doctrine of the long run" - the faith in the capacity of foresters to overcome the barriers of the uncertain future and look ahead and plan for long-range goals - which in many countries still underlies traditional forest management, can therefore be rejected. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes 5-8, but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition-two processes important in all ecosystems-are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21-40\%) reduced plant production by 5-10\%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41-60\%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO2 and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO2 and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts9. {\copyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

This net flux is the most uncertain term in the global carbon budget, not only because of uncertainties in rates of deforestation and forestation, but also because of uncertainties in the carbon density of the lands actually undergoing change. Furthermore, there are differences in approaches used to determine the flux that introduce variability into estimates in ways that are difficult to evaluate, and not all analyses consider the same types of management activities. Thirteen recent estimates of net carbon emissions from LULCC are summarized here. In addition to deforestation, all analyses considered changes in the area of agricultural lands (croplands and pastures). Some considered, also, forest management (wood harvest, shifting cultivation). None included emissions from the degradation of tropical peatlands. Means and standard deviations across the thirteen model estimates of annual emissions for the 1980s and 1990s, respectively, are 1.14 {\textpm} 0.23 and 1.12 {\textpm} 0.25 Pg C yrg -1 (1 Pg Combining double low line 1015 g carbon). Four studies also considered the period 2000-2009, and the mean and standard deviations across these four for the three decades are 1.14 {\textpm} 0.39, 1.17 {\textpm} 0.32, and 1.10 {\textpm} 0.11 Pg C yrg-1. For the period 1990-2009 the mean global emissions from LULCC are 1.14 {\textpm} 0.18 Pg C yrg-1. The standard deviations across model means shown here are smaller than previous estimates of uncertainty as they do not account for the errors that result from data uncertainty and from an incomplete understanding of all the processes affecting the net flux of carbon from LULCC. Although these errors have not been systematically evaluated, based on partial analyses available in the literature and expert opinion, they are estimated to be on the order of {\textpm} 0.5 Pg C yrg-1. {\copyright} Author(s) 2012.

Here we report a new estimate of annual fluxes from 1850 to 2015, updating earlier analyses with new estimates of both historical and current rates of LULCC and including emissions from draining and burning of peatlands in Southeast Asia. For most of the 186 countries included we relied on data from Food and Agriculture Organization to document changes in the areas of croplands and pastures since 1960 and changes in the areas of forests and ``other land'' since 1990. For earlier years we used other sources of information. We used a bookkeeping model that prescribed changes in carbon density of vegetation and soils for 20 types of ecosystems and five land uses. The total net flux attributable to LULCC over the period 1850--2015 is calculated to have been 145 {\textpm} 16 Pg C (1 standard deviation). Most of the emissions were from the tropics (102 {\textpm} 5.8 Pg C), generally increasing over time to a maximum of 2.10 Pg C yr-1 in 1997. Outside the tropics emissions were roughly constant at 0.5 Pg C yr-1 until 1940, declined to zero around 1970, and then became negative. For the most recent decade (2006--2015) global net emissions from LULCC averaged 1.11 ({\textpm}0.35) Pg C yr-1, consisting of a net source from the tropics (1.41 {\textpm} 0.17 Pg C yr-1), a net sink in northern midlatitudes (-0.28 {\textpm} 0.21 Pg C yr-1), and carbon neutrality in southern midlatitudes.},

Here we use land-use information from the FAO and a bookkeeping model to calculate the potential negative emissions that would result from allowing secondary forests to recover. We find the current gross carbon sink in forests recovering from harvests and abandoned agriculture to be -4.4~PgC/year, globally. The sink represents the potential for negative emissions if positive emissions from deforestation and wood harvest were eliminated. However, the sink is largely offset by emissions from wood products built up over the last century. Accounting for these committed emissions, we estimate that stopping deforestation and allowing secondary forests to grow would yield cumulative negative emissions between 2016 and 2100 of about 120 PgC, globally. Extending the lifetimes of wood products could potentially remove another 10 PgC from the atmosphere, for a total of approximately 130 PgC, or about 13~years of fossil fuel use at today's rate. As an upper limit, the estimate is conservative. It is based largely on past and current practices. But if greater negative emissions are to be realized, they will require an expansion of forest area, greater efficiencies in converting harvested wood to long-lasting products and sources of energy, and novel approaches for sequestering carbon in soils. That is, they will require current management practices to change.},

  abstract = {New values are derived for snow-free albedo of five plant functional types (PFTs) and the soil/litter substrate from data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on board Terra and Aqua. The derived albedo values are used to provide and test an improved specification of surface albedo for the land surface scheme known as the Joint U.K. Land Environment Simulator (JULES) that forms part of the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model (HadGEM) climate model. The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) global land cover map is used in combination with the MODIS albedo to estimate the albedo of each cover type in the IGBP classification scheme, from which the albedo values of the JULES PFTs are computed. The albedo of the soil/litter substrate, referred to as the soil background albedo, is derived from partially vegetated regions using a method that separates the vegetation contribution to the albedo signal from that of the soil/ litter substrate. The global fields of soil background albedo produced using this method exhibit more realistic spatial variations than the soil albedo map usually employed in conjunction with the JULES model. The revised total shortwave albedo values of the PFTs are up to 8\% higher than those in the existing HadGEM scheme. To evaluate the influence of these differences upon surface albedo in the climate model, differences are computed globally between mean monthly land surface albedo, modeled using the existing and revised albedo values, and MODIS data. Incorporating the revised albedo values into the model reduces the global rmse for snow-free July land surface albedo from 0.051 to 0.024, representing a marked improvement on the existing parameterization. {\copyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

Here we make simple but robust calculations of the maximum impact of such changes. Historical land-use changes (mostly deforestation) and fossil fuel emissions have caused an increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 of 90 ppm between the pre-industrial era and year 2000. The projected range of CO2 concentrations in 2100, under a range of emissions scenarios developed for the IPCC, is 170-600 ppm above 2000 levels. This range is mostly due to different assumptions regarding fossil fuel emissions. If all of the carbon so far released by land-use changes could be restored to the terrestrial biosphere, atmospheric CO2 concentration at the end of the century would be about 40-70 ppm less than it would be if no such intervention had occurred. Conversely, complete global deforestation over the same time frame would increase atmospheric concentrations by about 130-290 ppm. These are extreme assumptions; the maximum feasible reforestation and afforestation activities over the next 50 years would result in a reduction in CO2 concentration of about 15-30 ppm by the end of the century. Thus the time course of fossil fuel emissions will be the major factor in determining atmospheric CO2 concentrations for the foreseeable future.},

  abstract = {Background: There are high estimates of the potential climate change mitigation opportunity of using wood products. A significant part of those estimates depends on long-lived wood products in the construction sector replacing concrete, steel, and other non-renewable goods. Often the climate change mitigation benefits of this substitution are presented and quantified in the form of displacement factors. A displacement factor is numerically quantified as the reduction in emissions achieved per unit of wood used, representing the efficiency of biomass in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The substitution benefit for a given wood use scenario is then represented as the estimated change in emissions from baseline in a study's modelling framework. The purpose of this review is to identify and assess the central economic and technical assumptions underlying forest carbon accounting and life cycle assessments that use displacement factors or similar simple methods. Main text: Four assumptions in the way displacement factors are employed are analyzed: (1) changes in harvest or production rates will lead to a corresponding change in consumption of wood products, (2) wood building products are substitutable for concrete and steel, (3) the same mix of products could be produced from increased harvest rates, and (4) there are no market responses to increased wood use. Conclusions: After outlining these assumptions, we conclude suggesting that many studies assessing forest management or products for climate change mitigation depend on a suite of assumptions that the literature either does not support or only partially supports. Therefore, we encourage the research community to develop a more sophisticated model of the building sectors and their products. In the meantime, recognizing these assumptions has allowed us to identify some structural, production, and policy-based changes to the construction industry that could help realize the climate change mitigation potential of wood products.},

  abstract = {Research Highlights: Bark beetles are important agents of disturbance regimes in temperate forests, and specifically in a connected wind-bark beetle disturbance system. Large-scale windthrows trigger population growth of the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) from endemic to epidemic levels, thereby allowing the killing of Norway spruce trees over several consecutive years. Background and Objectives: There is a lack of evidence to differentiate how outbreaks are promoted by the effects of environmental variables versus beetle preferences of trees from endemic to outbreak. However, little is known about how individual downed-tree characteristics and local conditions such as tree orientation and solar radiation affect beetle colonization of downed trees. Materials and Methods: To answer this question, we investigated the infestation rates and determined tree death categories (uprooted, broken, and stump) in wind-damaged areas in Western Tatra Mts. in Carpathians (Slovakia) from 2014--2016, following a windthrow in May 2014. In total, we investigated 225 trees over eight transects. For every tree, we measured its morphological (tree height, crown characteristics), environmental (solar radiation, terrain conditions, trunk zenith), temporal (time since wind damage), and beetle infestation (presence, location of attack, bark desiccation) parameters. We applied Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM) to unravel the main drivers of I. typographus infestations. Results: Over the first year, beetles preferred to attack broken trees and sun-exposed trunk sides over uprooted trees; the infestation on shaded sides started in the second year along with the infestation of uprooted trees with lower desiccation rates. We found that time since wind damage, stem length, and incident solar radiation increased the probability of beetle infestation, although both solar radiation and trunk zenith exhibited nonlinear variability. Our novel variable trunk zenith appeared to be an important predictor of bark beetle infestation probability. We conclude that trunk zenith as a simple measure defining the position of downed trees over the terrain can anticipate beetle infestation. Conclusions: Our findings contribute to understanding of the bark beetle's preferences to colonize windthrown trees in the initial years after the primary wind damage. Further, our findings can help to identify trees that are most susceptible to beetle infestation and to prioritize management actions to control beetle population while maintaining biodiversity.},

This implies that sooner or later humanity will rely heavily on renewable energy sources. Here we model the effects of an idealized large-scale application of renewable energy on global and regional climate relative to a background climate of the representative concentration pathway 2.6 scenario (RCP2.6; ref.). We find that solar panels alone induce regional cooling by converting incoming solar energy to electricity in comparison to the climate without solar panels. The conversion of this electricity to heat, primarily in urban areas, increases regional and global temperatures which compensate the cooling effect. However, there are consequences involved with these processes that modulate the global atmospheric circulation, resulting in changes in regional precipitation.},

Benefits of aboveground carbon storage, water provisioning, and especially soil erosion control and biodiversity are better delivered by native forests, with compositionally simpler, younger plantations in drier regions performing particularly poorly. However, plantations exhibit an advantage in wood production.

  abstract = {Structurally intact tropical forests sequestered about half of the global terrestrial carbon uptake over the 1990s and early 2000s, removing about 15 per cent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions1--3. Climate-driven vegetation models typically predict that this tropical forest `carbon sink' will continue for decades4,5. Here we assess trends in the carbon sink using 244 structurally intact African tropical forests spanning 11 countries, compare them with 321 published plots from Amazonia and investigate the underlying drivers of the trends. The carbon sink in live aboveground biomass in intact African tropical forests has been stable for the three decades to 2015, at 0.66 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.53--0.79), in contrast to the long-term decline in Amazonian forests6. Therefore the carbon sink responses of Earth's two largest expanses of tropical forest have diverged. The difference is largely driven by carbon losses from tree mortality, with no detectable multi-decadal trend in Africa and a long-term increase in Amazonia. Both continents show increasing tree growth, consistent with the expected net effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and air temperature7--9. Despite the past stability of the African carbon sink, our most intensively monitored plots~suggest a post-2010 increase in carbon losses, delayed compared to Amazonia, indicating asynchronous carbon sink saturation on the two continents. A statistical model including carbon dioxide, temperature, drought and forest dynamics accounts for the observed trends and indicates a long-term future decline in the African sink, whereas the Amazonian sink continues to weaken rapidly. Overall, the uptake of carbon into Earth's intact tropical forests peaked in the 1990s. Given that the global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing in size, independent observations indicating greater recent carbon uptake into the Northern Hemisphere landmass10 reinforce our conclusion that the intact tropical forest carbon sink has already peaked. This saturation and ongoing decline of the tropical forest carbon sink has consequences for policies intended to stabilize Earth's climate.},

However, in low- and middle-income countries the economic, financial and institutional barriers for such transformative changes are high. Here, we show that if sustainable development in the land sector remained highly unequal and limited to high-income countries only, global AFOLU emissions would remain substantial throughout the 21st century. Our model-based projections highlight that overcoming global inequality is critical for land-based mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement. While also a scenario purely based on either global GHG emission pricing or on inclusive socio-economic development would achieve the stringent emissions reductions required, only the latter ensures major co-benefits for other Sustainable Development Goals, especially in low- and middle-income regions.},

However, assessing potential future carbon loss from tropical forests is important for evaluating the efficacy of programmes for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. Uncertainties are associated with different carbon stock responses in models with different representations of vegetation processes on the one hand, and differences in projected changes in temperature and precipitation patterns on the other hand. Here we present a systematic exploration of these sources of uncertainty, along with uncertainty arising from different emissions scenarios for all three main tropical forest regions: the Americas (that is, Amazonia and Central America), Africa and Asia. Using simulations with 22 climate models and the MOSES-TRIFFID land surface scheme, we find that only in one of the simulations are tropical forests projected to lose biomass by the end of the twenty-first century - and then only for the Americas. When comparing with alternative models of plant physiological processes, we find that the largest uncertainties are associated with plant physiological responses, and then with future emissions scenarios. Uncertainties from differences in the climate projections are significantly smaller. Despite the considerable uncertainties, we conclude that there is evidence of forest resilience for all three regions. {\copyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

Understanding the factors controlling land C uptake is critical for reducing uncertainties in projections of future climate. The relative importance of changing climate, rising atmospheric CO2, and other factors, however, remains unclear despite decades of research. Here, we use an ensemble of land models to show that models disagree on the primary driver of cumulative C uptake for 85\% of vegetated land area. Disagreement is largest in model sensitivity to rising atmospheric CO2 which shows almost twice the variability in cumulative land uptake since 1901 (1 s.d. of 212.8 PgC vs. 138.5 PgC, respectively). We find that variability in CO2 and temperature sensitivity is attributable, in part, to their compensatory effects on C uptake, whereby comparable estimates of C uptake can arise by invoking different sensitivities to key environmental conditions. Conversely, divergent estimates of C uptake can occur despite being based on the same environmental sensitivities. Together, these findings imply an important limitation to the predictability of C cycling and climate under unprecedented environmental conditions. We suggest that the carbon modeling community prioritize a probabilistic multi-model approach to generate more robust C cycle projections.},

  abstract = {Wood use is expanding to new markets, driven by the need to substitute fossil-intensive products and energy. Wood products can contribute to climate change mitigation, if they have a lower fossil footprint than alternative products serving the same function. However, the climate change mitigation potential is contingent on the net fossil and biogenic emissions over time, as well as the realism of the counterfactual scenario and market assumptions. This study aims to improve the consistency of assessing the avoided fossil emissions attributed to changes in wood use, and to estimate the additional mitigation potential of increased wood use in construction and textile markets based on wood harvested in Finland. The results show that, compared to baseline, an increase in the market share of wood leads to an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration by 2050. Thus, the substitution impacts of wood use are not large enough to compensate for the reduction in forest carbon sinks in the short and medium term. This outcome is further aggravated, considering the decarbonization of the energy sector driven by the Paris Agreement, which lowers the fossil emissions of competing sectors more than those of the forest sector. The expected decarbonization is a highly desirable trend, but it will further lengthen the carbon parity period associated with an increase in wood harvest. This creates a strong motive to pursue shifts in wood uses instead of merely expanding all wood uses.},

  abstract = {International efforts to mitigate human-caused changes in the Earth's climate are considering a system of incentives (debits and credits) that would encourage specific changes in land use that can help to reduce the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. The two primary land-based activities that would help to minimize atmospheric carbon dioxide are carbon storage in the terrestrial biosphere and the efficient substitution of biomass fuels and bio-based products for fossil fuels and energy-intensive products. These two activities have very different land requirements and different implications for the preservation of biodiversity and the maintenance of other ecosystem services. Carbon sequestration in living forests can be pursued on lands with low productivity, i.e. on lands that are least suitable for agriculture or intensive forestry, and are compatible with the preservation of biodiversity over large areas. In contrast, intensive harvest-and-use systems for biomass fuels and products generally need more productive land to be economically viable. Intensive harvest-and-use systems may compete with agriculture or they may shift intensive land uses onto the less productive lands that currently harbor most of the Earth's biodiversity. Win-win solutions for carbon dioxide control and biodiversity are possible, but careful evaluation and planning are needed to avoid practices that reduce biodiversity with little net decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Planning is more complex on a politically subdivided Earth where issues of local interest, national sovereignty, and equity come into play. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Climate change is expected to intensify the existing risks, particularly in southern regions, and create new opportunities in some northern areas. These risks and opportunities are characterised and interpreted across European regions by analysing over 300 highly relevant publications that appeared in the last decade. The result is a synthesis of the reasons for concern for European agricultural regions. The need to respond to these risks and opportunities is addressed by evaluating the costs and benefits of a number of technical and policy actions. The results highlight the importance of enhanced water use efficiency as a critical response to climate risks and the need for a more effective extension service. These results aim to assist stakeholders as they take up the adaptation challenge and develop measures to reduce the vulnerability of the sector to climate change. {\copyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {Climate extremes and land-use changes can have major impacts on the carbon cycle of ecosystems. Their combined effects have rarely been tested. We studied whether and how the abandonment of traditionally managed mountain grassland changes the resilience of carbon dynamics to drought. In an in situ common garden experiment located in a subalpine meadow in the Austrian Central Alps, we exposed intact ecosystem monoliths from a managed and an abandoned mountain grassland to an experimental early-summer drought and measured the responses of gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, phytomass and its components, and of leaf area index during the drought and the subsequent recovery period. Across all these parameters, the managed grassland was more strongly affected by drought and recovered faster than the abandoned grassland. A bivariate representation of resilience confirmed an inverse relationship of resistance and recovery; thus, low resistance was related to high recovery from drought and vice versa. In consequence, the overall perturbation of the carbon cycle caused by drought was larger in the managed than the abandoned grassland. The faster recovery of carbon dynamics from drought in the managed grassland was associated with a significantly higher uptake of nitrogen from soil. Furthermore, in both grasslands leaf nitrogen concentrations were enhanced after drought and likely reflected drought-induced increases in nitrogen availability. Our study shows that ongoing and future land-use changes have the potential to profoundly alter the impacts of climate extremes on grassland carbon dynamics.},

The services are divided into broad areas within which managers can identify specific management goals for individual forests or landscapes. Adaptation options exist for the major forest regions of the world but the scientific basis for these adaptation options and their potential effectiveness varies across regions. Because of the great variation in local conditions, no recommendations can be made that are applicable to an entire domain. The choice of management option will depend on the likely changes occurring in the forest, the management objectives of that forest, its past management history and a range of other factors. Local managers must have sufficient flexibility to choose the most appropriate suite of management options for their conditions. The current failure to implement fully the multi-faceted components of sustainable forest management is likely to limit the ability of forest management to adapt to climate change. Forest managers will need to plan at multiple spatial and temporal scales and will need to adopt adaptive collaborative management as their primary form of management. Careful monitoring and evaluation will be required, with a change in focus from outputs to outcomes. Keywords:},

  abstract = {A. Introduction The Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) considers new evidence of climate change based on many independent scientific analyses from observations of the climate system, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models. It builds upon the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), and incorporates subsequent new findings of research. As a component of the fifth assessment cycle, the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) is an important basis for information on changing weather and climate extremes. This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) follows the structure of the Working Group I report. The narrative is supported by a series of overarching highlighted conclusions which, taken together, provide a concise summary. Main sections are introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the methodological basis of the assessment. The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain). Confidence in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement.}

  abstract = {Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0{$^\circ$}C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8{$^\circ$}C to 1.2{$^\circ$}C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5{$^\circ$}C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. (high confidence) Warming from anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to the present will persist for centuries to millennia and will continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system, such as sea level rise, with associated impacts (high confidence), but these emissions alone are unlikely to cause global warming of 1.5{$^\circ$}C (medium confidence). Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5{$^\circ$}C than at present, but lower than at 2{$^\circ$}C (high confidence). These risks depend on the magnitude and rate of warming, geographic location, levels of development and vulnerability, and on the choices and implementation of adaptation and mitigation options (high confidence). Projected Climate Change, Potential Impacts and Associated Risks Climate models project robust differences in regional climate characteristics between present-day and global warming of 1.5{$^\circ$}C, and between 1.5{$^\circ$}C and 2{$^\circ$}C. These differences include increases in: mean temperature in most land and ocean regions (high confidence), hot extremes in most inhabited regions (high confidence), heavy precipitation in several regions (medium confidence), and the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions (medium confidence). By 2100, global mean sea level rise is projected to be around 0.1 metre lower with global warming of 1.5{$^\circ$}C compared to 2{$^\circ$}C (medium confidence). Sea level will continue to rise well beyond 2100 (high confidence), and the magnitude and rate of this rise depend on future emission pathways. A slower rate of sea level rise enables greater opportunities for adaptation in the human and ecological systems of small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas (medium confidence). On land, impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, including species loss and extinction, are projected to be lower at 1.5{$^\circ$}C of global warming compared to 2{$^\circ$}C. Limiting global warming to 1.5{$^\circ$}C compared to 2{$^\circ$}C is projected to lower the impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems and to retain more of their services to humans (high confidence). Limiting global warming to 1.5{$^\circ$}C compared to 2{$^\circ$}C is projected to reduce increases in ocean temperature as well as associated increases in ocean acidity and decreases in ocean oxygen levels (high confidence). Consequently, limiting global warming to 1.5{$^\circ$}C is projected to reduce risks to marine biodiversity, fisheries, and ecosystems, and their functions and services to humans, as illustrated by recent changes to Arctic sea ice and warm-water coral reef ecosystems (high confidence). Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5{$^\circ$}C and increase further with 2{$^\circ$}C. Most adaptation needs will be lower for global warming of 1.5{$^\circ$}C compared to 2{$^\circ$}C (high confidence). There are a wide range of adaptation options that can reduce the risks of climate change (high confidence). There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity for some human and natural systems at global warming of 1.5{$^\circ$}C, with associated losses (medium confidence). The number and availability of adaptation options vary by sector (medium confidence). * Headline statements are the overarching conclusions of the approved Summary for Policymakers which, taken together, provide a concise narrative.},

Thus, although SG might reduce globally aggregated risks, it may increase climate risks for some regions 8--10 . Here, using the high-resolution forecast-oriented low ocean resolution (HiFLOR) model---which resolves tropical cyclones and has an improved representation of present-day precipitation extremes 11,12--- alongside 12 models from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), we analyse the fraction of locations that see their local climate change exacerbated or moderated by SG. Rather than restoring temperatures, we assume that SG is applied to halve the warming produced by doubling CO 2 (half-SG). In HiFLOR, half-SG offsets most of the CO 2 -induced increase of simulated tropical cyclone intensity. Moreover, neither temperature, water availability, extreme temperature nor extreme precipitation are exacerbated under half-SG when averaged over any Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Extremes (SREX) region. Indeed, for both extreme precipitation and water availability, less than 0.4\% of the ice-free land surface sees exacerbation. Thus, while concerns about the inequality of solar geoengineering impacts are appropriate, the quantitative extent of inequality may be overstated 13 .},

We conducted a benchmarking of global GPP simulated by eight biome models participating in the second phase of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2a) with four meteorological forcing datasets (30 simulations), using independent GPP estimates and recent satellite data of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence as a proxy of GPP. The simulated global terrestrial GPP ranged from 98 to 141 Pg C yr-1 (1981-2000 mean); considerable inter-model and inter-data differences were found. Major features of spatial distribution and seasonal change of GPP were captured by each model, showing good agreement with the benchmarking data. All simulations showed incremental trends of annual GPP, seasonal-cycle amplitude, radiation-use efficiency, and water-use efficiency, mainly caused by the CO2 fertilization effect. The incremental slopes were higher than those obtained by remote sensing studies, but comparable with those by recent atmospheric observation. Apparent differences were found in the relationship between GPP and incoming solar radiation, for which forcing data differed considerably. The simulated GPP trends co-varied with a vegetation structural parameter, leaf area index, at model-dependent strengths, implying the importance of constraining canopy properties. In terms of extreme events, GPP anomalies associated with a historical El Ni{\~n}o event and large volcanic eruption were not consistently simulated in the model experiments due to deficiencies in both forcing data and parameterized environmental responsiveness. Although the benchmarking demonstrated the overall advancement of contemporary biome models, further refinements are required, for example, for solar radiation data and vegetation canopy schemes.},

  abstract = {Food consumption is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and evaluating its future warming impact is crucial for guiding climate mitigation action. However, the lack of granularity in reporting food item emissions and the widespread use of oversimplified metrics such as CO 2 equivalents have complicated interpretation. We resolve these challenges by developing a global food consumption GHG emissions inventory separated by individual gas species and employing a reduced-complexity climate model, evaluating the associated future warming contribution and potential benefits from certain mitigation measures. We find that global food consumption alone could add nearly 1 {$^\circ$}C to warming by 2100. Seventy five percent of this warming is driven by foods that are high sources of methane (ruminant meat, dairy and rice). However, over 55\% of anticipated warming can be avoided from simultaneous improvements to production practices, the universal adoption of a healthy diet and consumer- and retail-level food waste reductions.},

  abstract = {Interest is growing in methods for predicting and detecting regime shifts---changes in the structure of dynamical processes that cause shifts among alternative stable states. Here, we use locally linear, autoregressive state-space models to statistically identify nonlinear processes that govern the dynamics of time series. We develop both time-varying and threshold models. In time-varying autoregressive models with p time lags, AR( p), and vector autoregressive models for n-dimensional systems of order p{$\frac{1}{4}$}1, VAR(1), we assume that coefficients vary with time. We can infer an approaching regime shift if the coefficients indicate critical slowing down of the local dynamics of the system. In self- excited threshold models, we assume that the time series is governed by two autoregressive processes; the state variable switches between them when the time series crosses a threshold value.We use the existence of a statistically significant threshold as an indicator of alternative stable states. All models are fit to data using a state-space form that incorporates measurement error, and maximum likelihood estimation allows for statistically testing alternative hypotheses about the processes governing dynamics. Our model-based approach for forecasting regime shifts and identifying alternative stable states overcomes limitations of other common metric-based approaches and is a useful addition to the toolbox of methods for analyzing nonlinear time series.},

This technology has been increasingly pictured as key to reaching the Paris Agreement targets. But with only a few demonstration projects currently in operation, its deployment is far from projected. The large-scale deployment of BECCS is hindered by economic, social, and environmental barriers that have been subject to an increasing number of studies. As most research on BECCS tends to adopt a central planning perspective, the barriers related to strategic interactions and coordination issues within the BECCS value chain are often overlooked. Based on a systematic literature review, we identify coordination-related challenges for BECCS deployment. We describe three challenges to BECCS deployment that should be further examined through the lens of coordination: (i) trading biomass and ensuring its sustainability; (ii) reducing costs through synergies with other industries and shared CO 2 infrastructures; and (iii) coordinating policies internationally to provide revenues for BECCS.},

However, while extreme event impacts are increasingly recognized, methodologies to address such impacts and the degree of our understanding and prediction capabilities vary widely among different sectors and disciplines. Moreover, traditional climate extreme indices and large-scale multi-model intercomparisons that are used for future projections of extreme events and associated impacts often fall short in capturing the full complexity of impact systems. Climate Extremes and Their Implications for Impact and Risk Assessment describes challenges, opportunities and methodologies for the analysis of the impacts of climate extremes across various sectors to support their impact and risk assessment. It thereby also facilitates cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary discussions and exchange among climate and impact scientists. The sectors covered include agriculture, terrestrial ecosystems, human health, transport, conflict, and more broadly covering the human-environment nexus. The book concludes with an outlook on the need for more transdisciplinary work and international collaboration between scientists and practitioners to address emergent risks and extreme events towards risk reduction and strengthened societal resilience.},

The intensity of required adaptive measures and the relevance of old-growth forests as benchmark for managed forests are debated. Forest managers need to make decisions on stand treatment that are based on climatological and biological parameters with high uncertainties. We provided the conceptual basis for adaptive forest management and provide a number of case studies that reflect the options and limitations of ways of coping with climate change. The examples are derived from the experience of the authors. We conclude that only few forest types are either not strongly affected by climate change or do not require immediate adaptations of forest management. Many productive forests have stand properties that are decisively shaped by past management decisions, such as tree species composition, age distribution, rotation period, and stand structure. Maintaining these properties under the influence of climate change requires continuous and even increasing efforts of forest managers.},

  abstract = {The study of leaf anatomy and of the mechanisms of the opening and closing of stomatal guard cells leads one to suppose that the stomata constitute the main or even the sole regulating system in leaf transpiration. Meteorologists have developed a wide variety of formulae for estimating evaporation from vegetation that are based entirely on weather variables and take no account at all of the species composition or stomatal properties of the transpiring vegetation. These ``potential evaporation'' formulae are widely and, to a large degree, successfully used for estimating evaporation from vegetation that is not water-stressed. Transpiration depends on stomatal conductance, net radiation receipt and upon air saturation deficit, temperature, and wind speed. Saturation deficit and wind speed vary through leaf boundary layers, through canopies, and through the atmosphere above the canopies. The sensitivity of saturation deficit to changes in stomatal conductance depends on where the saturation deficit is measured. If all of the stomata on a single leaf change aperture in unison, there may be a substantial change in saturation deficit measured at the leaf surface but a negligible change in saturation deficit measured a centimetre or two away, outside the leaf boundary layer. {\copyright} 1986, Academic Press Inc.

Thereby, the term pointer year refers to years in which a majority of trees shows extraordinary growth responses, like very narrow (or wide) ring widths. A wide variety of methods has been used to analyze pointer years, hampering comparisons between studies. The latter illustrates that there is a strong need to harmonize pointer year detection methods. This review contributes to that by describing and comparing the main methods (and variants thereof) found in the literature for the last two decades, both in a qualitative and quantitative way. We discuss methodological considerations and provide recommendations how to proceed with pointer year detection in future. Given that the individual methods for pointer year detection were found to highlight different aspects of extraordinary growth, the one method cannot completely substitute the other. Hence, we suggest to use multiple methods in a harmonized way to get the deepest insight into the nature of pointer years.},

Its dominant fluxes, gross primary productivity (GPP), and respiration (in particular soil respiration, R S ), are typically estimated from independent satellite-driven models and upscaled in situ measurements, respectively. We combine carbon-cycle flux estimates and partitioning coefficients to show that historical estimates of global GPP and R S are irreconcilable. When we estimate GPP based on R S measurements and some assumptions about R S :GPP ratios, we found the resulted global GPP values (bootstrap mean \$\$\{149\}\_\{-23\}{\textasciicircum}\{+29\}\$\$ 149 - 23 + 29 Pg C yr -1 ) are significantly higher than most GPP estimates reported in the literature ( \$\$\{113\}\_\{-18\}{\textasciicircum}\{+18\}\$\$ 113 - 18 + 18 Pg C yr -1 ). Similarly, historical GPP estimates imply a soil respiration flux (Rs GPP , bootstrap mean of \$\$\{68\}\_\{-8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+10\}\$\$ 68 - 8 + 10 Pg C yr -1 ) statistically inconsistent with most published R S values ( \$\$\{87\}\_\{-8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+9\}\$\$ 87 - 8 + 9 Pg C yr -1 ), although recent, higher, GPP estimates are narrowing this gap. Furthermore, global R S :GPP ratios are inconsistent with spatial averages of this ratio calculated from individual sites as well as CMIP6 model results. This discrepancy has implications for our understanding of carbon turnover times and the terrestrial sensitivity to climate change. Future efforts should reconcile the discrepancies associated with calculations for GPP and Rs to improve estimates of the global carbon budget.},

The number of living stumps, and the number and height of sprouts were recorded annually and the biomass of the sprouts was calculated. Two hundred naturally regenerated downy and silver birches were examined. These were part of a commercial cleaning in late August 1983, which left 20-cm-high stumps. The experimental site was located on forest land in central Sweden (latitude 60{$^\circ$}15{$\prime$}N, longitude 16{$^\circ$}01{$\prime$}E). The stumps were categorised into four diameter classes: 10-19, 20-29, 30-39 and 40-50 mm. The site was examined in September of the year after cutting and on a number of occasions up to 9 years after cutting. The number of living stumps of each species was recorded. When the sprouts were 9 years old, their diameter at breast height was recorded. Then, the sprouts were cut and stems and branches were dried and weighted. After 1 and 9 years, the percentage of surviving downy birch stumps was 90\% and 61\%, respectively. The equivalent figures for silver birch were 82\% and 55\%. The number of sprouts per stump differed significantly between the species and the stump diameter classes. The greatest mean number of downy birch sprouts per stump (2.8{\textpm}0.3) was for the diameter class 40-50 mm, and for silver birch sprouts (2.3{\textpm}0.2), for the 30-39 mm stumps. The diameter at breast height, height and weight of individual sprouts 9 years after cutting were significantly different between downy and silver birches and the diameter classes. The mean downy birch sprout weight (1.00{\textpm}0.01 kg d.w. stump-1) varied between diameter classes and the heaviest sprout weight (1.18{\textpm}0.02 kg d.w. stump-1) was produced by 30-39 mm stumps. The heaviest silver birch sprout, 1.94{\textpm}0.04 kg d.w., was also produced by 40-50 mm stumps. The mean weight was 1.55{\textpm}0.05 kg d.w. The sprout biomass per living stump was significantly different between the species and the diameter classes. The mean sprout biomass per downy birch stump was 1.76{\textpm}0.15 kg and for silver birch sprouts 2.19{\textpm}0.22 kg. Equations for estimating the aboveground biomass (stem+branches) from diameter at breast height were developed for downy and silver birch sprouts. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Species life-history traits represent an adaptive response to disturbance and are an information legacy; in contrast, the abiotic and biotic structures (such as seeds or nutrients) produced by single disturbance events are material legacies. Disturbance characteristics that support or maintain these legacies enhance ecological resilience and maintain a ``safe operating space'' for ecosystem recovery. However, legacies can be lost or diminished as disturbance regimes and environmental conditions change, generating a ``resilience debt'' that manifests only after the system is disturbed. Strong effects of ecological memory on post-disturbance dynamics imply that contingencies (effects that cannot be predicted with certainty) of individual disturbances, interactions among disturbances, and climate variability combine to affect ecosystem resilience. We illustrate these concepts and introduce a novel ecosystem resilience framework with examples of forest disturbances, primarily from North America. Identifying legacies that support resilience in a particular ecosystem can help scientists and resource managers anticipate when disturbances may trigger abrupt shifts in forest ecosystems, and when forests are likely to be resilient.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

  abstract = {Spruce bark beetle outbreaks are common in Norway spruce forests following windstorm damage, due to ample availability of brood material. The realization of an outbreak depends on factors regulating the Ips typographus population dynamics, such as weather conditions and salvage cutting. In this study, we take an ecosystem modelling approach to analyse the influence of multiple environmental factors on the risk for I. typographus outbreaks. Model calculations of I. typographus phenology and population dynamics as a function of weather and brood tree availability were developed and implemented in the LPJ-GUESS ecosystem modelling framework. The model simulations were driven by gridded climate data covering Sweden with a spatial resolution of 0.5{$^\circ$} and a daily temporal resolution. Records on storm damage and I. typographus outbreak periods in Sweden for the period of 1960-2009 were used for model evaluation, and a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the model behaviour. The model simulations replicated the observed pattern in outbreak frequency, being more common in southern and central Sweden than in northern Sweden. A warmer climate allowing for more than one generation per year can increase the risk for attacks on living trees. The effect of countermeasures, aiming at either reduce the availability of brood material or the I. typographus population size, is dependent on a non-linear relation between I. typographus attack density and reproductive success. The sensitivity analysis indicated a major reduction in the risk of attacks on living trees by timely salvage cutting and cutting of infested trees. Knowledge uncertainties associated with attacks on standing trees, i.e. factors influencing tree defence capacity and I. typographus reproductive success, should be further addressed. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Research over the past 10 years has illustrated an important connection between dietary choices, the food systems required to produce them, and the subsequent impact on green-house gas (GHG) emissions. Several recent studies have used data on the GHG contribution of different food types to model the impact of different dietary patterns on GHG emissions; these studies have most commonly compared the average diet for a particular country to healthier dietary options and vegetarian options. We present a systematic review of this research that mod-els different dietary choices and the associated GHG emissions with the main aim in this paper of contrasting the research implications for policy and practice. A database search of CINAHL, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Mednar in July 2014 identified 21 primary studies modeling the GHG emissions related to a dietary pattern published since 1995. Diets containing a higher ratio of plant to animal prod-ucts were generally associated with lower GHG emissions; however, the results varied across countries and studies, as did the recommendations by the study authors. Some authors proposed leading with health messages that have a dual environmental gain, whereas others proposed messaging around environmental impact. These inconsistencies in recommended approaches to reduce diet-related GHG emissions relate not just to differences in research findings but also to assumptions about community and political support for action, and there is little empirical evidence on community knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intention at present to support these recommendations. The paper concludes with a commentary on the policy implications and the need for further research on how to frame the issue so as to garner community and political support to address the leading recommendations of this research.},

Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008--2010 from FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130 PgC yr-1 with the largest uncertainty in the tropics. Seasonal variations in independent SIF estimates agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise R2{$\sim$}0.75) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel-wise R2{$\sim$}0.6). Seasonal variations in FLUXCOM NEE show good consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes, particularly for temperate and boreal regions (R2{$>$}0.92). Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared to inversions and DGVMs. The FLUXCOM version which also uses meteorological inputs shows a strong co-variation in interannual patterns with inversions (R2=0.87 for 2001--2010). Mean regional NEE from FLUXCOM shows larger uptake than inversion and DGVM-based estimates, particularly in the tropics with discrepancies of up to several hundred grammes of carbon per square metre per year. These discrepancies can only partly be reconciled by carbon loss pathways that are implicit in inversions but not captured by the flux tower measurements such as carbon emissions from fires and water bodies. We hypothesize that a combination of systematic biases in the underlying eddy covariance data, in particular in tall tropical forests, and a lack of site history effects on NEE in FLUXCOM are likely responsible for the too strong tropical carbon sink estimated by FLUXCOM. Furthermore, as FLUXCOM does not account for CO2 fertilization effects, carbon flux trends are not realistic. Overall, current FLUXCOM estimates of mean annual and seasonal cycles of GPP as well as seasonal NEE variations provide useful constraints of global carbon cycling, while interannual variability patterns from FLUXCOM are valuable but require cautious interpretation. Exploring the diversity of Earth observation data and of machine learning concepts along with improved quality and quantity of flux tower measurements will facilitate further improvements of the FLUXCOM approach overall.]]{$>$}},

We ask whether wood properties, in particular differences between angiosperms and gymnosperms, and organismic diversity of colonizers contribute to wood decomposition. To test this, we exposed deadwood logs of 13 tree species, covering four gymnosperms and nine angiosperm species, in 30 plots under different forest management in three regions in Germany. After a decomposition time of 6.5 years Carpinus betulus and Fagus sylvatica showed the highest decay rates. We found a positive correlation of decay rate with enzyme activities, chemical wood properties (S, K concentration) and organismic diversity, while, heartwood character, lignin content, extractive concentration and phenol content were negatively correlated with decay rate across all 13 tree species. By applying a multi-model inference approach we found that the activity of the wood-degrading enzymes laccase and endocellulase, beetle diversity, heartwood presence, wood ray height and fungal diversity were the most important predictor variables for wood decay. Although we were not able to identify direct cause and effect relations by our approach, we conclude that enzyme activity and organismic diversity are the main drivers of wood decay rate, which greatly differed among tree species. Maintaining high tree species diversity will therefore result in high structural deadwood diversity in terms of decay rate and decay stage.},

  abstract = {Short rotation plantations are often considered as holding vast potentials for future global bioenergy supply. In contrast to raising biomass harvests in forests, purpose-grown biomass does not interfere with forest carbon (C) stocks. Provided that agricultural land can be diverted from food and feed production without impairing food security, energy plantations on current agricultural land appear as a beneficial option in terms of renewable, climate-friendly energy supply. However, instead of supporting energy plantations, land could also be devoted to natural succession. It then acts as a long-term C sink which also results in C benefits. We here compare the sink strength of natural succession on arable land with the C saving effects of bioenergy from plantations. Using geographically explicit data on global cropland distribution among climate and ecological zones, regionally specific C accumulation rates are calculated with IPCC default methods and values. C savings from bioenergy are given for a range of displacement factors (DFs), acknowledging the varying efficiency of bioenergy routes and technologies in fossil fuel displacement. A uniform spatial pattern is assumed for succession and bioenergy plantations, and the considered timeframes range from 20 to 100~years. For many parameter settings---in particular, longer timeframes and high DFs---bioenergy yields higher cumulative C savings than natural succession. Still, if woody biomass displaces liquid transport fuels or natural gas-based electricity generation, natural succession is competitive or even superior for timeframes of 20--50~years. This finding has strong implications with climate and environmental policies: Freeing land for natural succession is a worthwhile low-cost natural climate solution that has many co-benefits for biodiversity and other ecosystem services. A considerable risk, however, is C stock losses (i.e., emissions) due to disturbances or land conversion at a later time.},

  abstract = {Humans have transformed Europe's landscapes since the establishment of the first agricultural societies in the mid-Holocene. The most important anthropogenic alteration of the natural environment was the clearing of forests to establish cropland and pasture, and the exploitation of forests for fuel wood and construction materials. While the archaeological and paleoecological record documents the time history of anthropogenic deforestation at numerous individual sites, to study the effect that prehistoric and preindustrial deforestation had on continental-scale carbon and water cycles we require spatially explicit maps of changing forest cover through time. Previous attempts to map preindustrial anthropogenic land use and land cover change addressed only the recent past, or relied on simplistic extrapolations of present day land use patterns to past conditions. In this study we created a very high resolution, annually resolved time series of anthropogenic deforestation in Europe over the past three millennia by 1) digitizing and synthesizing a database of population history for Europe and surrounding areas, 2) developing a model to simulate anthropogenic deforestation based on population density that handles technological progress, and 3) applying the database and model to a gridded dataset of land suitability for agriculture and pasture to simulate spatial and temporal trends in anthropogenic deforestation. Our model results provide reasonable estimations of deforestation in Europe when compared to historical accounts. We simulate extensive European deforestation at 1000 BC, implying that past attempts to quantify anthropogenic perturbation of the Holocene carbon cycle may have greatly underestimated early human impact on the climate system. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The long residence time of carbon in forests and soils means that both the current state and future behavior of the terrestrial biosphere are influenced by past variability in climate and anthropogenic land use. Over the last half-millennium, European terrestrial ecosystems were affected by the cool temperatures of the Little Ice Age, rising CO 2 concentrations, and human induced deforestation and land abandonment. To quantify the importance of these processes, we performed a series of simulations with the LPJ dynamic vegetation model driven by reconstructed climate, land use, and CO 2 concentrations. Although land use change was the major control on the carbon inventory of Europe over the last 500 years, the current state of the terrestrial biosphere is largely controlled by land use change during the past century. Between 1500 and 2000, climate variability led to temporary sequestration events of up to 3 Pg, whereas increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations during the 20th century led to an increase in carbon storage of up to 15 Pg. Anthropogenic land use caused between 25 Pg of carbon emissions and 5 Pg of uptake over the same time period, depending on the historical and spatial pattern of past land use and the timing of the reversal from deforestation to afforestation during the last two centuries. None of the currently existing anthropogenic land use change datasets adequately capture the timing of the forest transition in most European countries as recorded in historical observations. Despite considerable uncertainty, our scenarios indicate that with limited management, extant European forests have the potential to absorb between 5 and 12 Pg of carbon at the present day. {\copyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Globally, post-disturbance salvage logging is becoming more predominant to recover economic value from timber in disturbed forests. This study collected comparative time-study data and analyzed the productivity of cutting for windfalls in clear cuttings and determined the cutting costs of windfalls. Furthermore, the logging (i.e., cutting and forwarding) costs of wind-damaged trees and those of undamaged standing Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees in clear cuts were calculated in Finland. The results revealed that the cutting productivity of windfalls was 19-33\% lower than that of undamaged stems. The cutting costs of windthrown stems with a volume of 0.3-1.5 m3 were 35-64\% higher and the logging costs of windfalls were 10-30\% higher than those of undamaged standing stems. The study provided new understanding regarding the productivity and costs of salvage logging operations under Finnish conditions. Even if the logging of windfalls is expensive and laborious, salvage logging operations are important for forest stands and their health to minimize post-disaster damage outbreaks in coniferous forests, such as the damage caused by bark beetles-mainly Ips typographus L.},

We are concerned, however, that recent claims in the popular media about CMNs in forests are disconnected from evidence, and that bias towards citing positive effects of CMNs has developed in the scientific literature. We first evaluated the evidence supporting three common claims. The claims that CMNs are widespread in forests and that resources are transferred through CMNs to increase seedling performance are insufficiently supported because results from field studies vary too widely, have alternative explanations or are too limited to support generalizations. The claim that mature trees preferentially send resources and defence signals to offspring through CMNs has no peer-reviewed, published evidence. We next examined how the results from CMN research are cited and found that unsupported claims have doubled in the past 25 years; a bias towards citing positive effects may obscure our understanding of the structure and function of CMNs in forests. We conclude that knowledge on CMNs is presently too sparse and unsettled to inform forest management.},

However, accurate impact assessments comprising larger spatial scales are lacking to date although these are critically needed given the expected disturbance intensification under a warming climate. Hence, our quantitative knowledge on current and future BD impacts, for example, on forest carbon (C) cycling, is strongly limited. We extended a dynamic global vegetation model to simulate ecosystem response to prescribed tree mortality and defoliation due to multiple biotic agents across United States forests during the period 1997--2015, and quantified the BD-induced vegetation C loss, that is, C fluxes from live vegetation to dead organic matter pools. Annual disturbance fractions separated by BD type (tree mortality and defoliation) and agent (bark beetles, defoliator insects, other insects, pathogens, and other biotic agents) were calculated at 0.5{$^\circ$} resolution from aerial-surveyed data and applied within the model. Simulated BD-induced C fluxes totaled 251.6 Mt C (annual mean: 13.2 Mt C year-1, SD {\textpm}7.3 Mt C year-1 between years) across the study domain, to which tree mortality contributed 95\% and defoliation 5\%. Among BD agents, bark beetles caused most C fluxes (61\%), and total insect-induced C fluxes were about five times larger compared to non-insect agents, for example, pathogens and wildlife. Our findings further demonstrate that BD-induced C cycle impacts (i) displayed high spatio-temporal variability, (ii) were dominated by different agents across BD types and regions, and (iii) were comparable in magnitude to fire-induced impacts. This study provides the first ecosystem model-based assessment of BD-induced impacts on forest C cycling at the continental scale and going beyond single agent-host systems, thus allowing for comparisons across regions, BD types, and agents. Ultimately, a perspective on the potential and limitations of a more process-based incorporation of multiple BDs in ecosystem models is offered.},

The ratio of water loss to carbon gain, or water-use efficiency, is a key characteristic of ecosystem function that is central to the global cycles of water, energy and carbon. Here we analyse direct, long-term measurements of whole-ecosystem carbon and water exchange. We find a substantial increase in water-use efficiency in temperate and boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere over the past two decades. We systematically assess various competing hypotheses to explain this trend, and find that the observed increase is most consistent with a strong CO 2 fertilization effect. The results suggest a partial closure of stomata - small pores on the leaf surface that regulate gas exchange - to maintain a near-constant concentration of CO 2 inside the leaf even under continually increasing atmospheric CO 2 levels. The observed increase in forest water-use efficiency is larger than that predicted by existing theory and 13 terrestrial biosphere models. The increase is associated with trends of increasing ecosystem-level photosynthesis and net carbon uptake, and decreasing evapotranspiration. Our findings suggest a shift in the carbon- and water-based economics of terrestrial vegetation, which may require a reassessment of the role of stomatal control in regulating interactions between forests and climate change, and a re-evaluation of coupled vegetation-climate models. {\copyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Key message: Adaptation of forest management to climate change requires an understanding of the effects of climate on forests, industries and communities; prediction of how these effects might change over time; and incorporation of this knowledge into management decisions. This requires multiple forms of knowledge and new approaches to forest management decisions. Partnerships that integrate researchers from multiple disciplines with forest managers and local actors can build a shared understanding of future challenges and facilitate improved decision making in the face of climate change.Context: Climate change presents significant potential risks to forests and challenges for forest managers. Adaptation to climate change involves monitoring and anticipating change and undertaking actions to avoid the negative consequences and to take advantage of potential benefits of those changes.Aims: This paper aimed to review recent research on climate change impacts and management options for adaptation to climate change and to identify key themes for researchers and for forest managers.Methods: The study is based on a review of literature on climate change impacts on forests and adaptation options for forest management identified in the Web of Science database, focusing on papers and reports published between 1945 and 2013.Results: One thousand one hundred seventy-two papers were identified in the search, with the vast majority of papers published from 1986 to 2013. Seventy-six percent of papers involved assessment of climate change impacts or the sensitivity or vulnerability of forests to climate change and 11~\% (130) considered adaptation. Important themes from the analysis included (i) predicting species and ecosystem responses to future climate, (ii) adaptation actions in forest management, (iii) new approaches and tools for decision making under uncertainty and stronger partnerships between researchers and practitioners and (iv) policy arrangements for adaptation in forest management.Conclusions: Research to support adaptation to climate change is still heavily focused on assessing impacts and vulnerability. However, more refined impact assessments are not necessarily leading to better management decisions. Multi-disciplinary research approaches are emerging that integrate traditional forest ecosystem sciences with social, economic and behavioural sciences to improve decision making. Implementing adaptation options is best achieved by building a shared understanding of future challenges among different institutions, agencies, forest owners and stakeholders. Research-policy-practice partnerships that recognise local management needs and indigenous knowledge and integrate these with climate and ecosystem science can facilitate improved decision making.},

The terrestrial carbon sink is increasing, yet the mechanisms responsible for its enhancement, and implications for the growth rate of atmospheric CO 2 , remain unclear. Here using global carbon budget estimates, ground, atmospheric and satellite observations, and multiple global vegetation models, we report a recent pause in the growth rate of atmospheric CO 2 , and a decline in the fraction of anthropogenic emissions that remain in the atmosphere, despite increasing anthropogenic emissions. We attribute the observed decline to increases in the terrestrial sink during the past decade, associated with the effects of rising atmospheric CO 2 on vegetation and the slowdown in the rate of warming on global respiration. The pause in the atmospheric CO 2 growth rate provides further evidence of the roles of CO 2 fertilization and warming-induced respiration, and highlights the need to protect both existing carbon stocks and regions, where the sink is growing rapidly.},

  abstract = {Life on Earth comes in many forms, but all life-forms share a common element in carbon. It is the basic building block of biology, and by trapping radiation it also plays an important role in maintaining the Earth's atmosphere at a temperature hospitable to life. Like all matter, carbon can neither be created nor destroyed, but instead is continuously exchanged between ecosystems and the environment through a complex combination of physics and biology. In recent decades, these exchanges have led to an increased accumulation of carbon on the land surface: the terrestrial carbon sink. Over the past 10 years (2007--2016) the sink has removed an estimated 3.61 Pg C year -1 from the atmosphere, which amounts to 33.7\% of total anthropogenic emissions from industrial activity and land-use change. This sink constitutes a valuable ecosystem service, which has significantly slowed the rate of climate change. Here, we review current understanding of the underlying biological processes that govern the terrestrial carbon sink and their dependence on climate, atmospheric composition, and human interventions.},

Here we constrain the likely historic effect of CO2 on global photosynthesis by combining terrestrial biosphere models, ecological optimality theory, remote sensing approaches and an emergent constraint based on global carbon budget estimates. Our analysis suggests that CO2 fertilization increased global annual terrestrial photosynthesis by 13.5 {\textpm} 3.5\% or 15.9 {\textpm} 2.9 PgC (mean {\textpm} s.d.) between 1981 and 2020.

  abstract = {Synthesis The quickly expanding literature on early warning signals for critical transitions in ecosystems suggests that critical slowing down is a key phenomenon to measure the distance to a tipping point in ecosystems. Such work is broadly misinterpreted as showing that slowing down is specific to tipping points. In this contribution, we show why this is not the case. Early warning signals based on critical slowing down indicate a broader class of situations where a system becomes increasingly sensitive to perturbations. Ecosystem responses to external changes can surprise us by their abruptness and irreversibility. Models have helped identifying indicators of impending catastrophic shifts, referred to as 'generic early warning signals'. These indicators are linked to a phenomenon known as 'critical slowing down' which describes the fact that the recovery rate of a system after a perturbation decreases when the system approaches a bifurcation - such as the classical fold bifurcation associated to catastrophic shifts. However, contrary to what has sometimes been suggested in the literature, a decrease in recovery rate cannot be considered as specific to approaching catastrophic shifts. Here, we analyze the behavior of early warning signals based on critical slowing down in systems approaching a range of catastrophic and non-catastrophic situations. Our results show that slowing down generally happens in situations where a system is becoming increasingly sensitive to external perturbations, independently of whether the impeding change is catastrophic or not. These results highlight that indicators specific to catastrophic shifts are still lacking. More importantly, they also imply that in systems where we have no reason to expect catastrophic transitions, slowing down may still be used in a more general sense as a warning signal for a potential decrease in stability. {\copyright} 2012 The Authors.},

Here we focus on improving the fire module. To improve the representation of ignitions, we introduced a reatment of lightning that allows the fraction of ground strikes to vary spatially and seasonally, realistically partitions strike distribution between wet and dry days, and varies the number of dry days with strikes. Fuel availability and moisture content were improved by implementing decomposition rates specific to individual plant functional types and litter classes, and litter drying rates driven by atmospheric water content. To improve water extraction by grasses, we use realistic plant-specific treatments of deep roots. To improve fire responses, we introduced adaptive bark thickness and post-fire resprouting for tropical and temperate broadleaf trees. All improvements are based on extensive analyses of relevant observational data sets. We test model performance for Australia, first evaluating parameterisations separately and then measuring overall behaviour against standard benchmarks. Changes to the lightning parameterisation produce a more realistic simulation of fires in southeastern and central Australia. Implementation of PFT-specific decomposition rates enhances performance in central Australia. Changes in fuel drying improve fire in northern Australia, while changes in rooting depth produce a more realistic simulation of fuel availability and structure in central and northern Australia. The introduction of adaptive bark thickness and resprouting produces more realistic fire regimes in Australian savannas. We also show that the model simulates biomass recovery rates consistent with observations from several different regions of the world characterised by resprouting vegetation. The new model (LPX-Mv1) produces an improved simulation of observed vegetation composition and mean annual burnt area, by 33 and 18\% respectively compared to LPX.},

PHS updates vegetation water stress and root water uptake to better reflect plant hydraulic theory, advancing the physical basis of the model. The new configuration introduces prognostic vegetation water potential, modeled at the root, stem, and leaf levels. Leaf water potential replaces soil potential as the basis for stomatal conductance water stress, and root water potential is used to implement hydraulic root water uptake, replacing a transpiration partitioning function. Point simulations of a tropical forest site (Caxiuan{\~a}, Brazil) under ambient conditions and partial precipitation exclusion highlight the differences between PHS and the previous CLM implementation. Model description and simulation results are contextualized with a list of benefits and limitations of the new model formulation, including hypotheses that were not testable in previous versions of the model. Key results include reductions in transpiration and soil moisture biases relative to a control model under both ambient and exclusion conditions, correcting excessive dry season soil moisture stress in the control model. PHS implements hydraulic gradient root water uptake, which allows hydraulic redistribution and compensatory root water uptake and results in PHS utilizing a larger portion of the soil column to buffer shortfalls in precipitation. The new model structure, which bases water stress on leaf water potential, could have significant implications for vegetation-climate feedbacks, including increased sensitivity of photosynthesis to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit.},

Both these outcomes rely on the capacity of NbS to support and enhance the health of an ecosystem: its biodiversity, the condition of its abiotic and biotic elements, and its capacity to continue to function despite environmental change. However, while understanding of ecosystem health outcomes of NbS for climate change mitigation has developed in recent years, the outcomes of those implemented for adaptation remain poorly understood. To address this, we systematically reviewed the outcomes of 109 nature-based interventions for climate change adaptation using 33 indicators of ecosystem health across eight broad categories (e.g., diversity, biomass, ecosystem composition). We showed that 88\% of interventions with reported positive outcomes for climate change adaptation also reported benefits for ecosystem health. We also showed that interventions were associated with a 67\% average increase in species richness. All eight studies that reported benefits for both climate change mitigation and adaptation also supported ecosystem health, leading to a ``triple win.'' However, there were also trade-offs, mainly for forest management and creation of novel ecosystems such as monoculture plantations of non-native species. Our review highlights two key limitations in our understanding of the outcomes of NbS for ecosystem health. First, a limited selection of metrics are used and these rarely include key aspects such as functional diversity and habitat connectivity. Second, taxonomic coverage is limited: 50\% of interventions only had evidence for effects on plants, and 57\% of outcomes did not distinguish between native and non-native species. We make suggestions of how to improve assessments of the ecosystem health outcomes of NbS, as well as policy recommendations to enable the upscaling of NbS that support flourishing and resilient ecosystems, and are effective in addressing both climate and biodiversity goals.},

  abstract = {Increased carbon storage with afforestation leads to a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and thus decreases radiative forcing and cools the Earth. However, afforestation also changes the reflective properties of the surface vegetation from more reflective pasture to relatively less reflective forest cover. This increase in radiation absorption by the forest constitutes an increase in radiative forcing, with a warming effect. The net effect of decreased albedo and carbon storage on radiative forcing depends on the relative magnitude of these two opposing processes. We used data from an intensively studied site in New Zealand's Central North Island that has long-term, ground-based measurements of albedo over the full short-wave spectrum from a developing Pinus radiata forest. Data from this site were supplemented with satellite-derived albedo estimates from New Zealand pastures. The albedo of a well-established forest was measured as 13 \% and pasture albedo as 20 \%. We used these data to calculate the direct radiative forcing effect of changing albedo as the forest grew. We calculated the radiative forcing resulting from the removal of carbon from the atmosphere as a decrease in radiative forcing of-104 GJ tC -1 yr -1. We also showed that the observed change in albedo constituted a direct radiative forcing of 2759 GJ ha -1 yr -1. Thus, following afforestation, 26.5 tC haĝ̂'1 needs to be stored in a growing forest to balance the increase in radiative forcing resulting from the observed albedo change. Measurements of tree biomass and albedo were used to estimate the net change in radiative forcing as the newly planted forest grew. Albedo and carbon-storage effects were of similar magnitude for the first four to five years after tree planting, but as the stand grew older, the carbon storage effect increasingly dominated. Averaged over the whole length of the rotation, the changes in albedo negated the benefits from increased carbon storage by 17-24 \%. {\copyright} 2011 Author(s).},

  abstract = {The world's forests store large amounts of carbon (C), and growing forests can reduce atmospheric CO2 by storing C in their biomass. This has provided the impetus for world-wide tree planting initiatives to offset fossil-fuel emissions. However, forests interact with their environment in complex and multifaceted ways that must be considered for a balanced assessment of the value of planting trees. First, one needs to consider the potential reversibility of C sequestration in trees through either harvesting or tree death from natural factors. If carbon storage is only temporary, future temperatures will actually be higher than without tree plantings, but cumulative warming will be reduced, contributing both positively and negatively to future climate-change impacts. Alternatively, forests could be used for bioenergy or wood products to replace fossil-fuel use which would obviate the need to consider the possible reversibility of any benefits. Forests also affect the Earth's energy balance through either absorbing or reflecting incoming solar radiation. As forests generally absorb more incoming radiation than bare ground or grasslands, this constitutes an important warming effect that substantially reduces the benefit of C storage, especially in snow-covered regions. Forests also affect other local ecosystem services, such as conserving biodiversity, modifying water and nutrient cycles, and preventing erosion that could be either beneficial or harmful depending on specific circumstances. Considering all these factors, tree plantings may be beneficial or detrimental for mitigating climate-change impacts, but the range of possibilities makes generalisations difficult. Their net benefit depends on many factors that differ between specific circumstances. One can, therefore, neither uncritically endorse tree planting everywhere, nor condemn it as counter-productive. Our aim is to provide key information to enable appropriate assessments to be made under specific circumstances. We conclude our discussion by providing a step-by-step guide for assessing the merit of tree plantings under specific circumstances.},

Pyranometers are subject to errors associated with characteristics of the sensor (cosine, spectral, and temperature responses), and general use (installation, dirt, moisture, and aging). Conservative estimates for measurement uncertainty are about 2 to 3 percent for thermopile and 3 to 6 percent for silicon photodiode pyranometers. .},

Classic designs were developed for real, non-simulated systems in agriculture, engineering, etc. These designs assume 'a few' factors (no more than 10 factors) with only 'a few' values per factor (no more than five values). These designs are mostly incomplete factorials (e.g., fractionals). The resulting input/output (I/O) data are analyzed through polynomial metamodels, which are a type of linear regression models. Modern designs were developed for simulated systems in engineering, management science, etc. These designs allow 'many factors (more than 100), each with either a few or 'many' (more than 100) values. These designs include group screening, Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), and other 'space filling' designs. Their I/O data are analyzed through second-order polynomials for group screening, and through Kriging models for LHS. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The variability among tree species gave rise to selection towards either of two contrasting water management types: isohydric or anisohydric. This study explores the variability of gs to {$\Psi$}l across tree species. Curves of gs({$\Psi$}l) were collected from the scientific literature for 70 woody plant species. The data set is comprised of angiosperm and gymnosperm species from all major forest biomes. The hypothesis that curves from different tree species diverge between isohydric and anisohydric behaviours was tested. Species-specific curves formed a continuum, rather than dichotomy between isohydric and anisohydric, as confirmed by distribution models. Alternatively, the water potential at 50\% of the maximum gs ({$\Psi$}gs50) was used to quantitatively compare between species. A major difference emerged among xylem anatomy classes whereby ring-porous species had higher absolute gs at {$\Psi$}l {$<$} -2 MPa than diffuse-porous and coniferous species. A positive, linear correlation was shown between {$\Psi$}gs50 and {$\Psi$}l at 50\% loss of xylem conductivity. The results suggest that stomatal sensitivity to leaf water potential strongly relates to xylem characteristics. The use of {$\Psi$}gs50 offers a quantitative alternative to the current, yet biased, distinction between isohydric and anisohydric species.},

The goal of this study was to investigate the links between grassland management intensity and orthopteran density at the field scale and to upscale this information to the landscape in order to guide management action at landscape scale. More specifically, we investigated the relationships between grassland management intensity, floral indicator species, and orthopteran abundance in grasslands with different land use in the SW Swiss Alps. Field vegetation surveys of indicator plant species were used to generate a management intensity proxy, to which field assessments of orthopterans were related. Orthopteran abundance showed a hump-shaped response to management intensity, with low values in intensified, nutrient-rich grasslands and in nutrient-poor, xeric grasslands, while it peaked in middle-intensity grasslands. Combined with remote-sensed data about grassland gross primary productivity, the above proxy was used to build landscape-wide, spatially explicit projections of the potential distribution of orthopteran-rich grasslands as possible foraging grounds for insectivorous vertebrates. This spatially explicit multitrophic approach enables the delineation of focal farmland areas in order to prioritize conservation action.},

  abstract = {Background: At the 15th Conference of Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Copenhagen, 2009, harvested wood products were identified as an additional carbon pool. This modification eliminates inconsistencies in greenhouse gas reporting by recognizing the role of the forest and timber sector in the global carbon cycle. Any additional CO2-effects related to wood usage are not considered by this modification. This results in a downward bias when the contribution of the forest and timber sector to climate change mitigation is assessed. The following article analyses the overall contribution to climate protection made by the forest management and wood utilization through CO2-emissions reduction using an example from the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Based on long term study periods (2011 to 2050 and 2100, respectively). Various alternative scenarios for forest management and wood usage are presented. Results: In the mid- to long-term (2050 and 2100, respectively) the net climate protection function of scenarios with varying levels of wood usage is higher than in scenarios without any wood usage. This is not observed for all scenarios on short and mid term evaluations. The advantages of wood usage are evident although the simulations resulted in high values for forest storage in the C pools. Even the carbon sink effect due to temporal accumulation of deadwood during the period from 2011 to 2100 is outbalanced by the potential of wood usage effects. Conclusions: A full assessment of the CO2-effects of the forest management requires an assessment of the forest supplemented with an assessment of the effects of wood usage. CO2-emission reductions through both fuel and material substitution as well as CO2 sink in wood products need to be considered. An integrated assessment of the climate protection function based on the analysis of the study's scenarios provides decision parameters for a strategic approach to climate protection with regard to forest management and wood use at regional and national levels. The short-term evaluation of subsystems can be misleading, rendering long-term evaluations (until 2100, or even longer) more effective. This is also consistent with the inherently long-term perspective of forest management decisions and measures.},

Substitution effects are assessed based on specific assumptions derived from life-cycle assessment studies, which for the purpose of comparison usually refer to the respective energy mix. This definition is, however, normative. Different assumptions regarding fossil fuel substitution, such as marginal benefit or changing energy mix, are also possible. This paper discusses which of these alternative assumptions are most appropriate for analyzing fossil fuel substitution and then, based on three different approaches (status quo, changing energy mix, marginal fossil), shows the variation in the results these assumptions provide. The calculations include three different forest management strategies in order to show the effects of forest C sinks and different wood volumes available for use (material and energy). Long-term simulations tracking the C effects of forestry and wood use reveal the greatest variations. These findings are useful for deciding between different forestry management scenarios and strategies for wood product and energy use from a climate protection perspective.},

  abstract = {For several reasons the conversion of mono-species into mixed-species forests is presently a major concern of forest management and policy in Central Europe. Although it is possible to show a clear trend in favour of mixed-species forests, private forest owners and some forest economists have often not favoured mixed forests, assuming that they are less profitable. The trend towards mixed forests seems mainly for ecological reasons, while sound economic analysis of mixed forests is still rare. Based on this background the objective of the study is to answer the following four questions: (1) Does the yield of mixed-species forests differ from that of pure forests? (2) Does the mixing of tree species influence the ecological stability of forests? (3) Is the economic value of a mixed forest less than that of a monoculture? (4) How do forest economic models integrate the findings on yield and ecological stability of mixed forests? To answer these questions a literature review was conducted on the possible impacts of mixed-species forests. In comparison to pure stands a greater yield is not necessarily given in mixed stands. Yet, mixed-species stands are better able to compensate disturbances than monocultures. Moreover, there is substantial evidence that mixed-species stands are more resistant against biotic and abiotic disturbances. Applying an extended forest economic model, it was possible to demonstrate that mixing large blocks of native broadleaf species into pure conifer forests may lead to a significant reduction of financial risk. From a risk-averse perspective the economic value of a mixed-species forest may thus be greater than that of a mono-species forest. Yet, it became clear that forest economists do not often integrate the research findings on yield and ecological stability of mixed stands in modelling, but rather apply simple bioeconomic modelling. Moreover, in the context of mixed forests economists also largely ignore even classical financial approaches, which consider risk and risk preferences. We concluded that forest economics has to close substantial research gaps. Firstly, the knowledge of how to integrate biophysical properties of mixed forests in bioeconomic modelling is still an open question. Secondly, forest economists have to adopt the modern approaches of financial theory and management science to value mixed forests. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

Here we combine the results from multidisciplinary research for a unique assessment based on a normalization of 23 ecological, economic and social indicators for four restoration options in the tropical Andes of Ecuador. A comparison of the outcomes among afforestation with native alder or exotic pine, pasture restoration with either low-input or intense management and the abandoned status quo shows that both variants of afforestation and intense pasture use improve the ecological value, but low-input pasture does not. Economic indicators favour either afforestation or intense pasturing. Both Mestizo and indigenous Saraguro settlers are more inclined to opt for afforestation.},

Applying this theory requires information on the covariance of uncertain returns between all combinations of the economic options and also assumes that returns are normally distributed. As it is usually difficult to fulfill all data requirements and assumptions, this paper proposes a variant of robust portfolio optimization as an alternative that needs less pre-information. The approach considers future uncertainties in a non-stochastic fashion through possible deviations from the nominal return of land-use alternatives. Maximizing the economic return of the land-use portfolio is conditional on meeting an inclusive set of constraints. These demand that a pre-defined return threshold is achieved by the robust solution for each uncertainty scenario considered. Based on data for eight agricultural crops common in the Ecuadorian lowlands, a comparison with portfolios generated by classical stochastic mean-variance optimization shows greater land-use diversification (through increased Shannon indices), but only moderate expected economic loss of non-stochastic robust land-use portfolios. We conclude that non-stochastic derivation of land-use portfolios is a good alternative to the classical stochastic model, in situations where information on economic input parameters is scarce.},

We refer to the rehabilitation of abandoned agricultural lands in Ecuador including two types of both afforestation and pasture rehabilitation, together with a succession option.

Our work shows that active integration of uncertainty is only important when optimizing single or highly correlated ecosystem services and that the multifunction effect on landscape diversity is stronger than the uncertainty effect.

  abstract = {Conversion of tropical forests is among the primary causes of global environmental change. The loss of their important environmental services has prompted calls to integrate ecosystem services (ES) in addition to socio-economic objectives in decision-making. To test the effect of accounting for both ES and socio-economic objectives in land-use decisions, we develop a new dynamic approach to model deforestation scenarios for tropical mountain forests. We integrate multi-objective optimization of land allocation with an innovative approach to consider uncertainty spaces for each objective. These uncertainty spaces account for potential variability among decision-makers, who may have different expectations about the future. When optimizing only socio-economic objectives, the model continues the past trend in deforestation (1975--2015) in the projected land-use allocation (2015--2070). Based on indicators for biomass production, carbon storage, climate and water regulation, and soil quality, we show that considering multiple ES in addition to the socio-economic objectives has heterogeneous effects on land-use allocation. It saves some natural forest if the natural forest share is below 38\%, and can stop deforestation once the natural forest share drops below 10\%. For landscapes with high shares of forest (38\%--80\% in our study), accounting for multiple ES under high uncertainty of their indicators may, however, accelerate deforestation. For such multifunctional landscapes, two main effects prevail: (a) accelerated expansion of diversified non-natural areas to elevate the levels of the indicators and (b) increased landscape diversification to maintain multiple ES, reducing the proportion of natural forest. Only when accounting for vascular plant species richness as an explicit objective in the optimization, deforestation was consistently reduced. Aiming for multifunctional landscapes may therefore conflict with the aim of reducing deforestation, which we can quantify here for the first time. Our findings are relevant for identifying types of landscapes where this conflict may arise and to better align respective policies.},

We develop a continuous stand-level optimisation approach that integrates multiple decision criteria, uncertain input data based on ellipsoidal uncertainty sets and biological interactions. The optimisation aims to derive silvicultural strategies that closely align with the objectives and uncertainty attitudes of decision-makers. The novel approach optimises tree species composition and harvesting regimes simultaneously. In our example, the decision criteria are the soil expectation value (SEV), the volume of timber harvested, the sum of cash flows and the average amount of carbon stored in the forest. We use input data for Norway spruce (Picea abies), Silver fir (Abies alba) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and integrate biological stand-level interactions represented by a) enhanced survival of tree species in mixed forests and b) the growth response of trees remaining after partial harvesting. The resulting optimal silvicultural strategies ranged from a clear-cutting system (when maximising SEV and ignoring uncertainty) to continuous cover forestry (maximising SEV and considering uncertainty). Our analyses did not support single species forestry -- even the clear-cutting system suggested a mixed rather than pure forest. Silvicultural strategies that consider multiple criteria stored up to 47\% more carbon than the clear-cutting system, but their SEVs were up to 39\% lower. Biological interactions influence the optimal stand composition and harvesting regime, while establishment costs and the discount rate affect the level achieved for each management criterion. Lower survival due to changes in climate hardly influenced the model results. Our optimisation approach is flexible and may integrate many more and different criteria. It is useful to derive silvicultural strategies to guide science-based recommendations for various forest decision-makers.},

We couple an empirical function of forest growth with survival modelling for the example of Norway spruce (Picea abies), using Monte-Carlo simulations to quantify the economic losses from natural disturbances. We illustrate the effect of extreme disturbance events by analyzing the lowest (worst) 5\% of simulated economic returns. Ranging between {\texteuro} -2,611 and -34,416 per hectare, disturbance-induced economic losses varied greatly, depending on the valuation approach applied. Accounting for extreme events and disturbance impacts on standing timber resulted in 262--1218\% higher losses compared to damages derived with common valuation approaches that neglect these aspects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that refraining from salvage logging after extreme disturbances does not necessarily result in major economic losses for forest owners, indicating a potential cost-effective avenue to improve forest biodiversity.

Yet, the quantification of the different dimensions of resilience remains challenging, particularly for long-lived systems such as forests. Here we present an analytical framework to study the economic resilience of different forest management systems, focusing on the rate of economic recovery after severe disturbance. Our framework quantifies the post-disturbance gain in the present value of a forest relative to a benchmark system as an indicator of economic resilience. Forest values and silvicultural interventions were determined endogenously from an optimization model and account for risks affecting tree survival. We consider the effects of differences in forest structure and tree growth post disturbance on economic resilience. We demonstrate our approach by comparing the economic resilience of continuous cover forestry against a clear fell system for typical conditions in Central Europe. Continuous cover forestry had both higher economic return and higher economic resilience than the clear fell system. The economic recovery from disturbance in the continuous cover system was between 18.2 and 51.5\% faster than in the clear fell system, resulting in present value gains of between 1733 and 4535 {\texteuro} ha -1 . The advantage of the continuous cover system increased with discount rate and stand age, and was driven by differences in both stand structure and economic return.

Here, to understand the role of non-market factors (for example, policies, climate anomalies or conflicts), we can compare observed trends to a reference (expected) scenario that excludes non-market factors. We define an expected scenario by simulating land-use decisions solely driven by market prices, productivities and presumably plausible decision-making. The land-use allocation model considers economic profits and uncertainties as incentives for forest conversion. We compare reference forest losses in Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia (2000--2019) with observed forest losses and assign differences from non-market factors. Our results suggest that non-market factors temporarily lead to lower-than-expected forest losses summing to 11.1 million hectares, but also to phases with higher-than-expected forest losses of 11.3 million hectares. Phases with lower-than-expected forest losses occurred earlier than those with higher-than-expected forest losses. The damages avoided by delaying emissions that would otherwise have occurred represent a social value of US\$61.6 billion (as of the year 2000). This result shows the economic importance of forest conservation efforts in the tropics, even if reduced forest loss might be temporary and reverse over time.},

A new generation of more complex models running scenarios for the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) is widely, and perhaps naively, expected to provide more detailed and more certain projections. Here we show that projected global temperature change from the new models is remarkably similar to that from those used in IPCC AR4 after accounting for the different underlying scenarios. The spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation change are also very consistent. Interestingly, the local model spread has not changed much despite substantial model development and a massive increase in computational capacity. Part of this model spread is irreducible owing to internal variability in the climate system, yet there is also uncertainty from model differences that can potentially be eliminated. We argue that defining progress in climate modelling in terms of narrowing uncertainties is too limited. Models improve, representing more processes in greater detail. This implies greater confidence in their projections, but convergence may remain slow. The uncertainties should not stop decisions being made. {\copyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To investigate these risks to tropical forest restoration, we performed 221 simulations with a dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-LMfire) driven by a range of future climate scenarios and ecophysiological responses to CO 2 concentrations. We show that carbon in restored tropical forests is largely preserved under the entire range of potential future climates, regardless of assumptions we make about the potential for CO 2 fertilization of photosynthesis. Restoring even half of the potential area can account for 56--69\% of the carbon storage, depending on whether areas are selected for low cost or high carbon gain.},

Moreover, we identify the urgency and potential of altered species distributions in favor of minor natives by comparing the niche dynamics of five major native tree species with the set of six minor natives in a case study. Our models project stark range contractions and range shifts among major tree species, strongly amplified under high emission scenarios. Abies alba, Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica are affected the strongest. While also experiencing range shifts, the minor European natives Castanea sativa, Sorbus torminalis, and Ulmus laevis all considerably expand their range potential across climate change scenarios.

Thirty-two lactating dairy cows, blocked into 2 genetic groups: 16 Holstein cows and 16 crossbred Holstein-Gir, with 522.6 {\textpm} 58.3 kg of body weight, 57.2 {\textpm} 20.9 d in lactation, producing 27.5 {\textpm} 5.0 kg/cow of milk and with 3.1 {\textpm} 1.8 lactations were evaluated (means {\textpm} standard error of the means). Cows were allocated into 4 treatments: control (CON), without plant extracts in the diet; oregano extract (OR), with the addition of 0.056\% of oregano extract in the dry matter (DM) of the diet; green tea (GT), with the addition of 0.028\% of green tea extract in the DM of the diet; and mixture, with the addition of 0.056\% oregano extract and 0.028\% green tea extract in the DM of the diet. The forage-to-concentrate ratio was 60:40. Forage was composed of corn silage (94\%) and Tifton hay (6\%); concentrate was based on ground corn and soybean meal. Plant extracts were supplied as powder, which was previously added and homogenized into 1 kg of concentrate in natural matter, top-dressed onto the total mixed diet. No treatment by day interaction was observed for any of the evaluated variables, but some block by treatment interactions were significant. In Holstein cows, the mixture treatment decreased gross energy and tended to decrease the total-tract apparent digestibility coefficient for crude protein and total digestible nutrients when compared with OR. During the gas measurement period, GT and OR increased the digestible fraction of the ingested DM and decreased CH4 expressed in grams per kilogram of digestible DMI compared with CON. The use of extracts did not change rumen pH, total volatile fatty acid concentration, milk yield, or most milk traits. Compared with CON, oregano addition decreased fat concentration in milk. The use of plant extracts altered some milk fatty acids but did not change milk fatty acids grouped according to chain length (short or long), saturation (unsaturated or saturated), total conjugated linoleic acids, and n-3 and n-6 contents. Green tea and oregano fed separately reduced gas emission in cows during the first third of lactation and have potential to be used as feed additives for dairy cows.},

  abstract = {Droughts are expected to become more frequent and more intense under climate change. Plant mortality rates and biomass declines in response to drought depend on stomatal and xylem flow regulation. Plants operate on a continuum of xylem and stomatal regulation strategies from very isohydric (strict regulation) to very anisohydric. Coexisting species may display a variety of isohydricity behaviors. As such, it can be difficult to predict how to model the degree of isohydricity at the ecosystem scale by aggregating studies of individual species. This is nonetheless essential for accurate prediction of ecosystem drought resilience. In this study, we define a metric for the degree of isohydricity at the ecosystem scale in analogy with a recent metric introduced at the species level. Using data from the AMSR-E satellite, this metric is evaluated globally based on diurnal variations in microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD), which is directly related to leaf water potential. Areas with low annual mean radiation are found to be more anisohydric. Except for evergreen broadleaf forests in the tropics, which are very isohydric, and croplands, which are very anisohydric, land cover type is a poor predictor of ecosystem isohydricity, in accordance with previous species-scale observations. It is therefore also a poor basis for parameterizing water stress response in land-surface models. For taller ecosystems, canopy height is correlated with higher isohydricity (so that rainforests are mostly isohydric). Highly anisohydric areas show either high or low underlying water use efficiency. In seasonally dry locations, most ecosystems display a more isohydric response (increased stomatal regulation) during the dry season. In several seasonally dry tropical forests, this trend is reversed, as dry-season leaf-out appears to coincide with a shift toward more anisohydric strategies. The metric developed in this study allows for detailed investigations of spatial and temporal variations in plant water behavior.},

We applied this approach to a model region in Saxony, Eastern Germany. For the estimation of the potentials of the model region to provide ecosystem services, we used a modified approach compared to the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). We then employed a benefit transfer and a purely expert driven approach to assess contribution of the land cover classes in our model region to the provision of ecosystem services. In a subsequent step, the services in our set were combined to ecosystem services groups that were designed together with regional actors, while considering their ideas, concerns and experiences in regional decision making. The latter was analyzed in a weighting experiment, in which different weighting approaches were tested. Based upon this, we analyzed the performance of the model region to provide ecosystem services and generated ecosystem services distribution maps. We could show that the different data gathering methods "benefit transfer" and "expert-based assessment" have a considerable impact on the evaluation outcomes. The results of our study show that the combination of selected services and land cover data can contribute to regional planning by communicating the effect of land cover change on ecosystem services groups, especially when applied as an evaluation basis in the tool Pimp Your Landscape (PYL). The approach supports also the assessment of the performance of a region to provide ecosystem services and the comparison of regions towards this aspect. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our approach that are related to coarse land cover data, lacking knowledge on the provision of ecosystem services at a landscape scale, and the difficulty to make relevant the ecosystem services concept in regional planning processes.},

Measurements were carried out on a plot which had similar stem circumference and basal area per ground area as the stand. Plot sap flux density agreed with tree canopy transpiration rate determined by the difference between above-canopy eddy correlation and forest floor lysimeter evaporation measurements. Daily sap flux varied by an order of magnitude among trees (2 to 87 kg day-1 tree-1). Over 50\% of plot sap flux density originated from 3 of 14 trees which emerged 2 to 5 m above the canopy. Maximum tree transpiration rate was significantly correlated with tree height, stem sapwood area, and stem circumference. Use of water stored in the trees was minimal. It is estimated that during growth and crown development, Nothofagus allocates about 0.06 m of circumference of main tree trunk or 0.01 m2 of sapwood per kg of water transpired over one hour. Maximum total conductance for water vapour transfer (including canopy and aerodynamic conductance) of emergent trees, calculated from sap flux density and humidity measurements, was 9.5 mm s-1 that is equivalent to 112 mmol m-2 s-1 at the scale of the leaf. Artificially illuminated shoots measured in the stand with gas exchange chambers had maximum stomatal conductances of 280 mmol m-2 s-1 at the top and 150 mmol m-2 s-1 at the bottom of the canopy. The difference between canopy and leaf-level measurements is discussed with respect to effects of transpiration on humidity within the canopy. Maximum total conductance was significantly correlated with leaf nitrogen content. Mean carbon isotope ratio was -27.76{\textpm}0.27‰ (average {\textpm}s.e.) indicating a moist environment. The effects of interactions between the canopy and the atmosphere on forest water use dynamics are shown by a fourfold variation in coupling of the tree canopy air saturation deficit to that of the overhead atmosphere on a typical fine day due to changes in stomatal conductance. {\copyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

In forest habitat-type stewardship, the employment of suitable management approaches is critical. It is assumed that knowledge about the natural processes, and tree and forest habitat traits is integrated into these approaches. In addition to known techniques, forest science and practice are often recommended by diverse stakeholders to consider and introduce diverse management regimes into day-to-day management. While many of them are sound, being grounded in ecological science, some still need to be evaluated. This study was focused on the presentation of changes in the forest environment. Additionally, it addressed natural and man-made disturbances that play an important role in day-to-day management and attempted to describe differences between them from various points of view. The study also presented facts in regard to the static and dynamic approaches to biodiversity conservation (in the sense of the objective-setting process), management with forest habitat types and the assessment of their conservation status. The 91K0 -- Illyrian Fagus sylvatica forest habitat types and 5130 -- Juniperus communis formations on calcareous grasslands were used for exemplifying different approaches.

Impacts above the Arctic Circle are addressed in Chapter 28 and impacts in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas in Chapter 30. Impacts in Malta, Cyprus, and other island states in Europe are discussed in Chapter 29. The European region has been divided into five sub-regions (see Figure 23-1): Atlantic, Alpine, Southern, Northern, and Continental. The sub-regions are derived by aggregating the climate zones developed by Metzger et al. (2005) and therefore represent geographical and ecological zones rather than political boundaries. The scientific evidence has been evaluated to compare impacts across (rather than within) sub-regions, although this was not always possible depending on the scientific information available. 23.1.1. Scope and Route Map of Chapter, The chapter is structured around key policy areas. Sections 23.3 to 23.6 summarize the latest scientific evidence on sensitivity climate, observed impacts and attribution, projected impacts, and adaptation options, with respect to four main categories of impacts: {$\bullet$} Production systems and physical infrastructure {$\bullet$} Agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and bioenergy production {$\bullet$} Health protection and social welfare {$\bullet$} Protection of environmental quality and biological conservation The benefit of assessing evidence in a regional chapter is that impacts across sectors can be described, and interactions between impacts can be identified. Further, the cross-sectoral decision making required to address climate change can be reviewed. The chapter also includes sections that were not in AR4.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Land-use changes have been shown to have large effects on climate and biogeochemical cycles, but so far most studies have focused on the effects of conversion of natural vegetation to croplands and pastures. By contrast, relatively little is known about the long-term influence of past agriculture on vegetation regrowth and carbon sequestration following land abandonment. We used the LPJ-GUESS dynamic vegetation model to study the legacy effects of different land-use histories (in terms of type and duration) across a range of ecosystems. To this end, we performed six idealized simulations for Europe and Africa in which we made a transition from natural vegetation to either pasture or cropland, followed by a transition back to natural vegetation after 20, 60 or 100 years. The simulations identified substantial differences in recovery trajectories of four key variables (vegetation composition, vegetation carbon, soil carbon, net biome productivity) after agricultural cessation. Vegetation carbon and composition typically recovered faster than soil carbon in subtropical, temperate and boreal regions, and vice versa in the tropics. While the effects of different land-use histories on recovery periods of soil carbon stocks often differed by centuries across our simulations, differences in recovery times across simulations were typically small for net biome productivity (a few decades) and modest for vegetation carbon and composition (several decades). Spatially, we found the greatest sensitivity of recovery times to prior land use in boreal forests and subtropical grasslands, where post-agricultural productivity was strongly affected by prior land management. Our results suggest that land-use history is a relevant factor affecting ecosystems long after agricultural cessation, and it should be considered not only when assessing historical or future changes in simulations of the terrestrial carbon cycle but also when establishing long-term monitoring networks and interpreting data derived therefrom, including analysis of a broad range of ecosystem properties or local climate effects related to land cover changes.},

However, the acceptance and feasibility of land-based mitigation projects depends on potential side effects on other important ecosystem functions and their services. Here, we use projections of future land use and land cover for different land-based mitigation options from two land-use models (IMAGE and MAgPIE) and evaluate their effects with a global dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS). In the landuse models, carbon removal was achieved either via growth of bioenergy crops combined with carbon capture and storage, via avoided deforestation and afforestation, or via a combination of both. We compare these scenarios to a reference scenario without land-based mitigation and analyse the LPJ-GUESS simulations with the aim of assessing synergies and trade-offs across a range of ecosystem service indicators: Carbon storage, surface albedo, evapotranspiration, water runoff, crop production, nitrogen loss, and emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds. In our mitigation simulations cumulative carbon storage by year 2099 ranged between 55 and 89 GtC. Other ecosystem service indicators were influenced heterogeneously both positively and negatively, with large variability across regions and land-use scenarios. Avoided deforestation and afforestation led to an increase in evapotranspiration and enhanced emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, and to a decrease in albedo, runoff, and nitrogen loss. Crop production could also decrease in the afforestation scenarios as a result of reduced crop area, especially for MAgPIE land-use patterns, if assumed increases in crop yields cannot be realized. Bioenergy-based climate change mitigation was projected to affect less area globally than in the forest expansion scenarios, and resulted in less pronounced changes in most ecosystem service indicators than forest-based mitigation, but included a possible decrease in nitrogen loss, crop production, and biogenic volatile organic compounds emissions.},

  abstract = {Land use and climate changes both affect terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we used three combinations of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways (SSP1xRCP26, SSP3xRCP60, and SSP5xRCP85) as input to three dynamic global vegetation models to assess the impacts and associated uncertainty on several ecosystem functions: terrestrial carbon storage and fluxes, evapotranspiration, surface albedo, and runoff. We also performed sensitivity simulations in which we kept either land use or climate (including atmospheric CO2) constant from year 2015 on to calculate the isolated land use versus climate effects. By the 2080--2099 period, carbon storage increases by up to 87 {\textpm} 47 Gt (SSP1xRCP26) compared to present day, with large spatial variance across scenarios and models. Most of the carbon uptake is attributed to drivers beyond future land use and climate change, particularly the lagged effects of historic environmental changes. Future climate change typically increases carbon stocks in vegetation but not soils, while future land use change causes carbon losses, even for net agricultural abandonment (SSP1xRCP26). Evapotranspiration changes are highly variable across scenarios, and models do not agree on the magnitude or even sign of change of the individual effects. A calculated decrease in January and July surface albedo (up to -0.021 {\textpm} 0.007 and -0.004 {\textpm} 0.004 for SSP5xRCP85) and increase in runoff (+67 {\textpm} 6 mm/year) is largely driven by climate change. Overall, our results show that future land use and climate change will both have substantial impacts on ecosystem functioning. However, future changes can often not be fully explained by these two drivers and legacy effects have to be considered.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems continuously adapt to interacting environmental drivers that change over time. Consequently, the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystem may presently still be affected by past anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., deforestation) and other environmental changes (e.g., climate change). However, even though such so-called ``legacy effects'' are implicitly included in many carbon cycle modeling studies, they are typically not explicitly quantified and therefore scientists might not be aware of their long-term importance. Here, we use the ecosystem model LPJ-GUESS to quantify legacy effects for the 21st century and the respective contributions of the following environmental drivers: climate change, CO2 fertilization, land use change, wood harvest, nitrogen deposition, and nitrogen fertilization. According to our simulations, the combined legacy effects of historical (1850--2015) environmental changes result in a land carbon uptake of +126 Gt C over the future (2015--2099) period. This by far exceeds the impacts of future environmental changes (range -53 Gt C to +16 Gt C for three scenarios) and is comparable in magnitude to historical carbon losses (-154 Gt C). Legacy effects can mainly be attributed to ecosystems still adapting to historical increases in atmospheric CO2 (+65 Gt C) and nitrogen deposition (+33 Gt C), but long-term vegetation regrowth following agricultural abandonment (+8 Gt C) and wood harvest (+19 Gt C) also play a role. The response of the biosphere to historical environmental changes dominates future terrestrial carbon cycling at least until midcentury. Legacy effects persist many decades after environmental changes occurred and need to be considered when interpreting changes and estimating terrestrial carbon uptake potentials.},

While this substantially reduced ecosystem carbon storage, the impacts of these land cover changes on terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) have not been adequately resolved yet. Here, we combine high-resolution datasets of satellite-derived GPP and environmental predictor variables to estimate the potential GPP of forests, grasslands, and croplands around the globe. With a mean GPP of 2.0 kg C m -2 yr -1 forests represent the most productive land cover on two thirds of the total area suitable for any of these land cover types, while grasslands and croplands on average reach 1.5 and 1.8 kg C m -2 yr -1 , respectively. Combining our potential GPP maps with a historical land-use reconstruction indicates a 4.4\% reduction in global GPP from agricultural expansion. This land-use-induced GPP reduction is amplified in some future scenarios as a result of ongoing deforestation (e.g., the large-scale bioenergy scenario SSP4-3.4) but partly reversed in other scenarios (e.g., the sustainability scenario SSP1-1.9) due to agricultural abandonment. Comparing our results to simulations from state-of-the-art Earth System Models, we find that all investigated models deviate substantially from our estimates and from each other. Our maps could be used as a benchmark to reduce this inconsistency, thereby improving projections of land-based climate mitigation potentials.},

  abstract = {Forest trees are the dominant species in many parts of the world and predicting how they might respond to climate change is a vital global concern. Trees are capable of long-distance gene flow, which can promote adaptive evolution in novel environments by increasing genetic variation for fitness. It is unclear, however, if this can compensate for maladaptive effects of gene flow and for the long-generation times of trees. We critically review data on the extent of long-distance gene flow and summarise theory that allows us to predict evolutionary responses of trees to climate change. Estimates of long-distance gene flow based both on direct observations and on genetic methods provide evidence that genes can move over spatial scales larger than habitat shifts predicted under climate change within one generation. Both theoretical and empirical data suggest that the positive effects of gene flow on adaptation may dominate in many instances. The balance of positive to negative consequences of gene flow may, however, differ for leading edge, core and rear sections of forest distributions. We propose future experimental and theoretical research that would better integrate dispersal biology with evolutionary quantitative genetics and improve predictions of tree responses to climate change. {\copyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

  abstract = {Background: Unmanaged or old-growth forests are of paramount importance for carbon sequestration and thus for the mitigation of climate change among further implications, e.g. biodiversity aspects. Still, the importance of those forests for climate change mitigation compared to managed forests is under controversial debate. We evaluate the adequacy of referring to CO2 flux measurements alone and include external impacts on growth (nitrogen immissions, increasing temperatures, CO2 enrichment, changed precipitation patterns) for an evaluation of central European forests in this context.Results: We deduce that the use of CO2 flux measurements alone does not allow conclusions on a superiority of unmanaged to managed forests for mitigation goals. This is based on the critical consideration of uncertainties and the application of system boundaries. Furthermore, the consideration of wood products for material and energetic substitution obviously overrules the mitigation potential of unmanaged forests. Moreover, impacts of nitrogen immissions, CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere, increasing temperatures and changed precipitation patterns obviously lead to a meaningful increase in growth, even in forests of higher age.Conclusions: An impact of unmanaged forests on climate change mitigation cannot be valued by CO2 flux measurements alone. Further research is needed on cause and effect relationships between management practices and carbon stocks in different compartments of forest ecosystems in order to account for human-induced changes. Unexpected growth rates in old-growth forests - managed or not - can obviously be related to external impacts and additionally to management impacts. This should lead to the reconsideration of forest management strategies. {\copyright} 2012 Krug et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to examine the response of Quercus rubra L. seedlings to coppicing. In a greenhouse experiment, growth, biomass distribution, leaf gas exchange, and water and carbohydrate relations were measured for 1-year-old seedlings that were either coppiced when dormant at the time of planting or left intact as controls. Coppicing induced sprouting from the base of the stem, and, in general, the physiology of sprouts and controls was similar. However, the relative growth rate (RGR) of sprouts was 9\% higher than that of controls, allowing sprouts to compensate fully for the initial mass lost to coppicing. In a second experiment, in an outdoor cold frame, growth, biomass distribution, leaf gas exchange and plant water relations were measured on 1-year-old seedlings that were either coppiced at the time of planting (dormant-coppiced), coppiced soon after bud break (active-coppiced) or left intact (controls). Dormant coppicing again had little impact on seedling physiology, and dormant-coppiced plants again compensated for initial mass loss with a higher RGR. In contrast, active-coppiced seedlings did not compensate for initial mass loss, as their RGR did not differ from that of controls. By the tenth week of the study, leaf gas exchange rates of active-coppiced sprouts were higher than those of dormant-coppiced and control seedlings. Active-coppiced sprouts also had a greater soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductivity (expressed on a leaf area basis) and a lower ratio of leaf area to root surface area than did controls. Across treatments, photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were positively correlated with soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductivity, and gas exchange rates and hydraulic conductivity were negatively related to leaf:root area ratio. Thus, the removal of actively growing shoots may have altered subsequent leaf gas exchange largely through coppice-induced changes in leaf-root balance. Copyright {\copyright} 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

  abstract = {Estimates of leaf area index obtained with indirect measurement techniques, which are replacing more arduous destructive sampling methods, are frequently questioned due to light interception by woody elements and a non-random distribution of foliage elements. Usually, branches are assumed to be positioned randomly with respect to leaves or shoots in the canopy. However, in this study of boreal forest architecture, branches are shown to be preferentially shaded by other non-woody elements (e.g. shoots or leaves) in both coniferous and deciduous species of the boreal region. A new instrument called a Multiband Vegetation Imager (MVI) is used to capture two-band (Visible, 400-620 nm and Near-Infrared, 720-950 nm) image pairs of contrasting Canadian boreal forest canopies during the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). The spatial relationship of branches and photosynthetically active foliage is studied to estimate the fraction of the effective branch hemi-surface area index (B(e)) that is masked by leaves and shoots. We suggest an approach that corrects indirect LAI measurements using the LAI-2000 or a similar instrument by correcting for the following biases: (1) the effective canopy branch hemi-surface area that is not masked by leaves or shoots in the canopy, (2) the amount of stem hemi-surface area beneath crowns, (3) leaf (or shoot) ({\textohm}(e)({\texttheta})) and branch ({\textohm}(b)({\texttheta})) non-random spatial distributions in the canopy, and (4) the fraction of maximum LAI resulting from defoliation in the canopy. In boreal aspen, MVI image analysis shows that 95\% of the effective branch hemi-surface area is masked by other foliage in the canopy. In jack pine and black spruce forests, 80-90\% of the effective branch hemi-surface area is masked by other foliage in the canopy. These estimates suggest the fraction of indirect LAI that consists of branches intercepting light is less than 10\%. Therefore, branches generally do not intercept a significant amount of beam radiation in boreal forests, and do not significantly bias indirect LAI measurements. However, stems, which comprise 30-50\% of the total woody area in this study, may not be preferentially shaded by leafy foliage. Therefore, stem contribution to indirect LAI estimates measured with the LAI-2000 or a similar instrument cannot be overlooked. MVI estimates of the total branch hemi-surface area index agree to within 10-40\% of direct measurements made in similar species; however, the error between indirect and direct measurements may be due largely to difficulties associated with obtaining adequate sampling so that the error may fall within the noise level of measurements.},

We examined how mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks and drought have contributed to the fire regime of lodgepole pine forests in northwestern Colorado and adjacent areas of southern Wyoming over the past century. We used dendroecological methods to reconstruct the pre-fire history of MPB outbreaks in twenty lodgepole pine stands that had burned between 1939 and 2006 and in 20 nearby lodgepole pine stands that were otherwise similar but that had not burned. Our data represent c. 80\% of all large fires that had occurred in lodgepole pine forests in this study area over the past century. We also compared Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) values between fire years and non-fire years. Burned stands were no more likely to have been affected by outbreak prior to fires than were nearby unburned stands. However, PDSI and AET values were both lower during fire years than during non-fire years. This work indicates that climate has been more important than outbreaks to the fire regime of lodgepole pine forests in this region over the past century. Indeed, we found no detectable increase in the occurrence of high-severity fires following MPB outbreaks. Dry conditions, rather than changes in fuels associated with outbreaks, appear to be most limiting to the occurrence of severe fires in these forests. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Flood damages have exhibited a rapid upward trend, both globally and in Europe, faster than population and economic growth. Hence, vigorous attempts of attribution of changes have been made. Flood risk and vulnerability tend to change over many areas, due to a range of climatic and nonclimatic impacts whose relative importance is site-specific. Flooding is a complex phenomenon and there are several generating mechanisms, among others intense and/or long-lasting precipitation, snowmelt, ice jam. Projected climate-driven changes in future flood frequency are complex, depending on the generating mechanism, e.g., increasing flood magnitudes where floods result of heavy rainfall and possibly decreasing magnitudes where floods are generated by spring snowmelt. Climate change is likely to cause an increase of the risk of riverine flooding across much of Europe. Projections of flood hazard in Europe based on climatic and hydrological models, reviewed in this paper, illustrate possible changes of recurrence of a 100-year flood (with probability of exceedance being 1-in-100 years) in Europe. What used to be a 100-year flood in the control period is projected to become either more frequent or less frequent in the future time horizon of concern. For a large part of the continent, large flooding is projected to become more commonplace in future, warmer climate. Due to the large uncertainty of climate projections, it is currently not possible to devise a scientifically-sound procedure for redefining design floods (e. g. 100-year flood) in order to adjust flood defenses. For the time being, we recommend to adjust design floods using a "climate change factor" approach. {\copyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {Forecasts of rapid climate change raise the question how quickly species can evolutionarily adapt to future climates. The adaptability of forest trees to environmental changes is generally promoted by high levels of genetic diversity and gene flow, but it can also be slowed down by long generation times and low mortality of established trees. Here, we investigate the adaptation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Silver birch (Betula pendula) to climate change induced prolongation of the thermal growing season. We use quantitative genetic individual-based simulations to disentangle the relative roles of mortality, dispersal ability and maturation age for the speed of adaptation. The simulations predict that after 100 years of climate change, the genotypic growth period length of both species will lag more than 50\% behind the climatically determined optimum. This lag is reduced by increased mortality of established trees, whereas earlier maturation and higher dispersal ability had comparatively minor effects. The evolutionary lag behind environmental change shown in our simulations stresses the importance of accounting for evolutionary processes in forecasts of the future dynamics and productivity of forests. Sensitivity of the adaptation speed to mortality suggests that species experiencing high mortality rates as well as populations subject to regular disturbances such as storms or fires might be the quickest to adapt to a warming climate. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Atmospheric change encompassing a rising carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is one component of Global Change that affects various ecosystem processes and functions. The effects of elevated CO2 (eCO2) on belowground processes are incompletely understood due to complex interactions among various ecosystem fluxes and components such as net primary productivity, carbon (C) inputs to soil, and the living and dead soil C and nutrient pools. Here we summarize the literature on the impacts of eCO2 on 1) cycling of C and nitrogen (N), 2) microbial growth and enzyme activities, 3) turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) and induced priming effects including N mobilization/immobilization processes, and 4) associated nutrient mobilization from organic sources, 5) water budget with consequences for soil moisture, 6) formation and leaching of pedogenic carbonates, as well as 7) mobilization of nutrients and nonessential elements through accelerated weathering. We show that all effects in soil are indirect: they are mediated by plants through increased net primary production and C inputs by roots that foster intensive competition between plants and microorganisms for nutrients. Higher belowground C input from plants under eCO2 is compensated by faster C turnover due to accelerated microbial growth, metabolism and respiration, higher enzymatic activities, and priming of soil C, N and P pools. We compare the effects of eCO2 on pool size and associated fluxes in: soil C stocks vs. belowground C input, microbial biomass vs. CO2 soil efflux vs. various microbial activities and functions, dissolved organic matter content vs. its production, nutrient stocks vs. fluxes etc. Based on these comparisons, we generalize that eCO2 will have little impacts on pool size but will strongly accelerate the fluxes in biologically active and stable pools and consequently will accelerates biogeochemical cycles of C, nutrients and nonessential elements.},

However, in a dynamic vegetation model actual damage to stands and individual trees is needed to get a dynamical progression of the vegetation. We present a prototype for a new approach to modelling forest wind damage at the regional scale, which we incorporate within a dynamic vegetation model. The approach is based on knowledge from both empirical and mechanical models and calculates the damaged fraction of a cohort based on wind load and a sensitivity that depends on the current physical state and history of the cohort in relation to the ecosystem. The modelling concept has been developed, calibrated and evaluated for Swedish conditions but can be applicable to other similar areas with minor modification. Because of the stochastic nature of local wind load and the difficulty of describing the stand-level exposure, the ability to explain observed damage at stand level was low. Regional level variation in damage, which more depends on the wind load, was however explained reasonably well (R2=0.43). We suggest that this is a useful concept for evaluating alternatives of forest management under different climate scenarios in the process of adaptation to future storm-damage risks. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Here idealized perturbations to land surface properties are imposed in a global model to understand how such forcings drive shifts in zonal mean atmospheric energy transport and zonal mean tropical precipitation. For a uniform decrease in global land albedo, the albedo forcing and a positive water vapor feedback contribute roughly equally to increased energy absorption at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), while radiative changes due to the temperature and cloud cover response provide a negative feedback and energy loss at TOA. Decreasing land albedo causes a northwards shift in the zonal mean intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The combined effects on ITCZ location of all atmospheric feedbacks roughly cancel for the albedo forcing; the total ITCZ shift is comparable to that predicted for the albedo forcing alone. For an imposed increase in evaporative resistance that reduces land evaporation, low cloud cover decreases in the northern mid-latitudes and more energy is absorbed at TOA there; longwave loss due to warming provides a negative feedback on the TOA energy balance and ITCZ shift. Imposed changes in land albedo and evaporative resistance modulate fundamentally different aspects of the surface energy budget. However, the pattern of TOA radiation changes due to the water vapor and air temperature responses are highly correlated for these two forcings because both forcings lead to near-surface warming.},

Many classical time series models can be formulated as DLMs, including ARMA models and standard multiple linear regression models. The models can be seen as general regression models where the coefficients can vary in time. In addition, they allow for a state space representation and a formulation as hierarchical statistical models, which in turn is the key for efficient estimation by Kalman formulas and by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. A dynamic linear model can handle non-stationary processes, missing values and non-uniform sampling as well as observations with varying accuracies. This chapter gives an introduction to DLM and shows how to build various useful models for analysing trends and other sources of variability in geodetic time series.},

Random forests achieve competitive predictive performance and are computationally efficient to train and test, making them excellent candidates for real-world prediction tasks. The most popular random forest variants (such as Breiman's random forest and extremely randomized trees) operate on batches of training data. Online methods are now in greater demand. Existing online random forests, however, require more training data than their batch counterpart to achieve comparable predictive performance. In this work, we use Mondrian processes (Roy and Teh, 2009) to construct ensembles of random decision trees we call Mondrian forests. Mondrian forests can be grown in an incremental/online fashion and remarkably, the distribution of online Mondrian forests is the same as that of batch Mondrian forests. Mondrian forests achieve competitive predictive performance comparable with existing online random forests and periodically retrained batch random forests, while being more than an order of magnitude faster, thus representing a better computation vs accuracy tradeoff.},

In particular, we find that tropospheric ozone is projected to decrease (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6) or increase (RCP8.5) between 2000 and 2100, with variations in methane a strong contributor to this spread. The associated tropospheric ozone global radiative forcing is shown to be in agreement with the estimate used in the RCPs, except for RCP8.5. Surface ozone in 2100 is projected to change little compared from its 2000 distribution, a much-reduced impact from previous projections based on the A2 high-emission scenario. In addition, globally-averaged stratospheric ozone is projected to recover at or beyond pre-1980 levels. Anthropogenic aerosols are projected to strongly decrease in the 21st century, a reflection of their projected decrease in emissions. Consequently, sulfate deposition is projected to strongly decrease. However, nitrogen deposition is projected to increase over certain regions because of the projected increase in NH3 emissions. {\copyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

However, it is not clear what type of reforestation must be used and there is a risk that the techniques used in industrial timber plantations will become the default methodology. This is unlikely to be sufficient because of the well-known relationship between biodiversity and ecological functioning. Restoration may be achieved through natural regeneration but this may not always occur at critical locations. Ecological restoration involving species-rich plantings might also be used but can be difficult to implement at landscape scales. I review here the consequence of planting more limited numbers of species and the effects of this on the delivery of ecosystem services. Evidence suggests many commonly sought ecosystem services---though not all---may be generated by the modest levels of species richness provided these species have appropriate traits. The literature also shows that the alpha diversity of restored forests is not the only driver of functionality and that the location and extent of any reforestation are significant as well; beta and gamma diversity may also affect functionality but these relationships remain unclear. Encouraging the adoption of even moderately diverse plantings at landscape scales and at key locations will require policies and institutions to balance the type, location, and scale of restoration and make the necessary trade-offs between national and local aspirations. New approaches and metrics will have to be developed to monitor and assess restoration success at these larger scales.},

Obviously drought stress proves to be the climatic factor essentially responsible for the restriction of productivity, growth, and survival of evergreen woody plants in Mediterranean-type regions. In addition, low temperature effects in marginal districts, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the Mediterranean basin and near to the altitudinal limit of the maquis vegetation, should not be neglected. Such effects are frost damage during severe winters, which are to be expected every 10--12 years (Morettini 1961), as well as reduced dry matter production and decreased vigour of the plants due to the depression of metabolic activities by suboptimal temperatures in December and January (Killian 1933, Larcher 1961a,b,1969a,b, Eckardt et al. 1975, Weinmann, Kreeb 1975). Recently the significance of low winter temperatures and episodic frost in limiting distribution range and causing alterations in the floristic composition of the maquis vegetation in Europe has been emphasized by Larcher (1980a) and Mitrakos (1980). Experimental data from previous investigations are evaluated here to illustrate the view that low temperatures, which were a major stress factor during Pleistocene, still exert a considerable influence on survival, reproduction and productivity of Mediterranean evergreen woody plants.},

The focus is on carbon sequestration processes; appropriate measurements for international, regional and local scale assessment of net ecosystem carbon balance; and life cycle analysis, with special attention given to the concept of substitution of fossil fuels with bioenergy from forests. Given the slow dynamic of forest carbon, life cycle analysis needs to account for pre-existing forest conditions, since carbon neutrality (i.e., net ecosystem carbon balance of forests is zero) can take at least a century to achieve in many cases. The substitution of wood for more energy-intensive materials has probably been overestimated compared with cases in which additionality, permanence and saturation of wood building stores are considered. GHG emission policies will need to account for emissions associated with bioenergy, which is currently not considered internationally. Thus, GHG emissions resulting from substitution for fossil fuels will have to be more accurately represented if their true impact is to be understood. {\copyright} 2011 Future Science Ltd.},

Here, we examine the relative merits of afforestation, reforestation, management changes, and harvest residue bioenergy use in the Pacific Northwest. This region represents some of the highest carbon density forests in the world, which can store carbon in trees for 800 y or more. Oregon's net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was equivalent to 72\% of total emissions in 2011--2015. By 2100, simulations show increased net carbon uptake with little change in wildfires. Reforestation, afforestation, lengthened harvest cycles on private lands, and restricting harvest on public lands increase NECB 56\% by 2100, with the latter two actions contributing the most. Resultant cobenefits included water availability and biodiversity, primarily from increased forest area, age, and species diversity. Converting 127,000 ha of irrigated grass crops to native forests could decrease irrigation demand by 233 billion m3{$\cdot$}y-1. Utilizing harvest residues for bioenergy production instead of leaving them in forests to decompose increased emissions in the short-term (50 y), reducing mitigation effectiveness. Increasing forest carbon on public lands reduced emissions compared with storage in wood products because the residence time is more than twice that of wood products. Hence, temperate forests with high carbon densities and lower vulnerability to mortality have substantial potential for reducing forest sector emissions.

'The British Ecological Society aims to promote the science of ecology through research and to use the findings of such research to educate the public and influence policy decisions which involve ecological matters.' Yet, how successful have we been in influencing UK and EU environmental policy? 2. Many scientists hold to the 'deficit model' of turning science into policy, the view that if only politicians are told what the science reveals, 'correct' policies will automatically follow. Nothing could be further from the truth. Politicians have all kinds of reasons, some valid, some less valid, not to adopt what often seem to us to be common sense policies to protect the environment. 3. Here, I explore some of the successes and failures of ecologists to influence UK and European environmental policy, using acid deposition, the collapse of global marine fisheries, GM crops and climate change, carbon dioxide and ocean acidification as examples. I briefly review the extensive literature (largely ignored by natural scientists) on what social scientists have to say about evidence-based policy-making (or the lack of it) and why it often appears to be so difficult to persuade politicians to adopt sound environmental policies. 4. Synthesis and applications. Ecologists can, and do, influence government policy on the environment, but often via complex and iterative interactions that can be painfully slow, and may require fundamental changes in politicians' belief systems, values and norms. {\copyright} 2007 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Forest disturbances can cause shifts in boreal vegetation cover from predominantly evergreen to deciduous trees or non-forest dominance. This, in turn, impacts land surface properties and, potentially, regional climate. Accurately considering such shifts in future projections of vegetation dynamics under climate change is crucial but hindered e.g. uncertainties in future 5 disturbance regimes. In this study, we investigate how sensitive future projections of boreal forest dynamics are to additional changes in disturbance regimes. We use the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS to investigate and disentangle the impacts of climate change and intensifying disturbance regimes in future projections of boreal vegetation cover as well as changes in land surface properties such as albedo and evapotranspiration. Our simulations find that warming alone drives shifts towards more densely forested landscapes, and more intense disturbances reduce tree cover in favor of shrubs and grasses, while 10 the interaction between climate and disturbances leads to an expansion of deciduous trees. Our results additionally indicate that warming decreases albedo and increases evapotranspiration, while more intense disturbances have the opposite effect, potentially offsetting climate impacts. Warming and disturbances are thus comparably important agents of change in boreal forests. Our findings highlight future disturbance regimes as a key source of model uncertainty and underscore the necessity of accounting for disturbances-induced effects on vegetation composition and land surface-atmosphere feedback.},

  abstract = {A significant area of the oak forests in Turkey has been historically managed by short-rotation coppicing for wood production. Coppice management was almost abandoned in Turkey in 2006 and so investigating its impact on forest carbon (C) sequestration has become an important issue. Therefore, we investigated the net effect of this change in management on C sequestration by oak forests in Turkey using field measurement data and a forest C model (Forest Biomass and Dead organic matter Carbon (FBDC) model). The FBDC model estimated the annual forest C dynamics and considered the effect of the substitution of wood for fossil fuels under two management scenarios over a 100-year period: (1) abandoning coppice (no management) and (2) continuing coppice (20-year-interval harvest). The field measurement data were used to parameterize the FBDC model to the study sites and to verify the simulated C stocks. Continuing coppice management constrained an increase in the C stocks (116.0--140.3 Mg C ha -1 ) and showed a mean annual C sequestration of 0.6 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 if wood was substituted for fossil fuels. In contrast, abandoning coppicing practices increased the level of forest C stocks (128.1--236.2 Mg C ha -1 ), enhancing the mean annual C sequestration to 1.1 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 . Accordingly, the abandonment of coppice management increased the mean annual C sequestration by 0.5 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 in the long-term. However, sensitivity analysis showed a possibility of a larger difference in C sequestration between the two scenarios due to a decrease in the stand productivity by repeated coppices and a high likelihood of a lower substitution effect. The verification supported the scientific reliability of the simulation results. Our study can provide a scientific basis for enhancing C sequestration in coppice forests.},

In many cases funding is obtained through the claimed carbon capture of the trees, presented as immediate and durable, whereas reforested plots need time and maintenance to realise their carbon capture potential. Further, claims usually overlook the environmental costs of natural or anthropogenic disturbances during the forest's lifetime, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the reforestation are not allowed for. This study uses life cycle assessment to quantify the carbon footprint of setting up a reforestation plot in the Peruvian Amazon. In parallel, we combine a soil carbon model with an above- and below-ground plant carbon model to predict the increase in carbon stocks after planting. We compare our results with the carbon capture claims made by a reforestation platform. Our results show major errors in carbon accounting in reforestation projects if they (1) ignore the time needed for trees to reach their carbon capture potential; (2) ignore the GHG emissions involved in setting up a plot; (3) report the carbon capture potential per tree planted, thereby ignoring limitations at the forest ecosystem level; or (4) under-estimate tree losses due to inevitable human and climatic disturbances. Further, we show that applications of biochar during reforestation can partially compensate for project emissions.},

In 25 forests in Sweden subjected to thinning for biodiversity values, we tested whether survival and growth of sprouts are related to stump diameter. Stem diameters vary under conservation thinning and earlier work had indicated high survival of stumps of small diameter. We also tested whether a continuum of responses in sprouting existed among the 14 species, as predicted by earlier work. We cut on average 26~\% of the basal area (mean basal area 28~m2/ha) and analysed 1,044 stumps (diameters 10--76~cm). The response of the species after 9~years ranged along a continuum from weak to strong sprouting. Survival was highest for Corylus avellena (95~\% of cut individuals survived) and Tilia cordata (85~\%), then decreased as follows; Crataegus spp.~{$>~$}Alnus glutinosa~{$>~$}Prunus avium~{$>~$}Fraxinus excelsior~{$>~$}Quercus robur/Q. petraea~{$>~$}Salix caprea~{$>~$}Sorbus aucuparia~{$>~$}Acer platanoides~{$>~$}Betula pendula, to Betula pubescens (8~\%) and Fagus sylvatica (8~\%). Within species, stump survival was unrelated to stump diameter. Mean maximal sprout height of surviving stumps varied from about 1 to 4~m among the species after 9~years. Sprout height was unrelated to stump diameter. Stump survival (\%) and mean sprout height were positively correlated across species. In conclusion, stem diameter had no effect on sprouting, but the 14 species could be clearly ranked in regrowth. Our results are useful in planning thinning of mixed forests for biodiversity conservation, for biomass harvest, or combined purposes.},

Most proposed climate mitigation strategies rely on a progressive transition to carbon-efficient technologies to reduce industrial emissions, substantially supported by policies to maintain or enhance the terrestrial carbon stock in forests and other ecosystems. This strategy may be challenged if terrestrial sequestration capacity is affected by future climate feedbacks, but how and to what extent is little understood. Here, we show that climate mitigation strategies are highly sensitive to future natural disturbance rates (e.g. fires, hurricanes, droughts), because of the potential effect of disturbances on the terrestrial carbon balance. Generally, altered disturbance rates affect the pace of societal and technological transitions required to achieve the mitigation target, with substantial consequences on the energy sector and the global economy. An understanding of the future dynamics and consequences of natural disturbances on terrestrial carbon balance is thus essential for developing robust climate mitigation strategies and policies. {\copyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere -- the global carbon budget -- is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, respectively, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land-cover change data and bookkeeping models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {\textpm}1{$\sigma$}. For the last decade available (2007--2016), EFF was 9.4 {\textpm} 0.5 GtC yr-1, ELUC 1.3 {\textpm} 0.7 GtC yr-1, GATM 4.7 {\textpm} 0.1 GtC yr-1, SOCEAN 2.4 {\textpm} 0.5 GtC yr-1, and SLAND 3.0 {\textpm} 0.8 GtC yr-1, with a budget imbalance BIM of 0.6 GtC yr-1 indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For year 2016 alone, the growth in EFF was approximately zero and emissions remained at 9.9 {\textpm} 0.5 GtC yr-1. Also for 2016, ELUC was 1.3 {\textpm} 0.7 GtC yr-1, GATM was 6.1 {\textpm} 0.2 GtC yr-1, SOCEAN was 2.6 {\textpm} 0.5 GtC yr-1, and SLAND was 2.7 {\textpm} 1.0 GtC yr-1, with a small BIM of -0.3 GtC. GATM continued to be higher in 2016 compared to the past decade (2007--2016), reflecting in part the high fossil emissions and the small SLAND consistent with El Ni{\~n}o conditions. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 402.8 {\textpm} 0.1 ppm averaged over 2016. For 2017, preliminary data for the first 6--9 months indicate a renewed growth in EFF of +2.0 \% (range of 0.8 to 3.0 \%) based on national emissions projections for China, USA, and India, and projections of gross domestic product (GDP) corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Qu{\'e}r{\'e} et al., 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

Daily global CO2 emissions decreased by --17\% (--11 to --25\% for {\textpm}1{$\sigma$}) by early April 2020 compared with the mean 2019 levels, just under half from changes in surface transport.

Here, we produce the first reference data set and a prototype of a globally consistent forest management map with high spatial detail on the most prevalent forest management classes such as intact forests, managed forests with natural regeneration, planted forests, plantation forest (rotation up to 15 years), oil palm plantations, and agroforestry. We developed the reference dataset of 226 K unique locations through a series of expert and crowdsourcing campaigns using Geo-Wiki ( https://www.geo-wiki.org/ ). We then combined the reference samples with time series from PROBA-V satellite imagery to create a global wall-to-wall map of forest management at a 100 m resolution for the year 2015, with forest management class accuracies ranging from 58\% to 80\%. The reference data set and the map present the status of forest ecosystems and can be used for investigating the value of forests for species, ecosystems and their services.},

Climate change, however, may undermine these efforts and modify the relationships and benefits related to the ecosystem services provided by forest ecosystems. Hence, managers must account for climate impacts on future forest dynamics, based on the understanding of processes and functions. Here, we address this issue and compute the value of multiple ecosystem services (wood production, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation) linked to European beech forests, considering local economic conditions. Our results show that mature European beech forests may sequester up to 4 tC.ha-1.year-1 and contribute to climate mitigation actions. The optimal management solutions may focus on wood production in regions with higher productivity and wood price. In regions with high productivity and low interest rates, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation may be simultaneously promoted by an expansion of forest conservation areas. In general, biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration acted synergistically. In contrast, wood production displayed trade-offs with the former ecosystem services, especially in countries with higher interest rates and low wood price. We conclude that forest productivity and local socio-economic conditions may mediate the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {In response to the urgent need for improved mapping of global biomass and the lack of any current space systems capable of addressing this need, the BIOMASS mission was proposed to the European Space Agency for the third cycle of Earth Explorer Core missions and was selected for Feasibility Study (Phase A) in March 2009. The objectives of the mission are 1) to quantify the magnitude and distribution of forest biomass globally to improve resource assessment, carbon accounting and carbon models, and 2) to monitor and quantify changes in terrestrial forest biomass globally, on an annual basis or better, leading to improved estimates of terrestrial carbon sources (primarily from deforestation); and terrestrial carbon sinks due to forest regrowth and afforestation. These science objectives require the mission to measure above-ground forest biomass from 70{$^\circ$} N to 56{$^\circ$} S at spatial scale of 100-200m, with error not exceeding {\textpm}20\% or {\textpm}10tha-1 and forest height with error of {\textpm}4m. To meet the measurement requirements, the mission will carry a P-Band polarimetric SAR (centre frequency 435MHz with 6MHz bandwidth) with interferometric capability, operating in a dawn-dusk orbit with a constant incidence angle (in the range of 25{$^\circ$}-35{$^\circ$}) and a 25-45day repeat cycle. During its 5-year lifetime, the mission will be capable of providing both direct measurements of biomass derived from intensity data and measurements of forest height derived from polarimetric interferometry. The design of the BIOMASS mission spins together two main observational strands: (1) the long heritage of airborne observations in tropical, temperate and boreal forest that have demonstrated the capabilities of P-band SAR for measuring forest biomass; (2) new developments in recovery of forest structure including forest height from Pol-InSAR, and, crucially, the resistance of P-band to temporal decorrelation, which makes this frequency uniquely suitable for biomass measurements with a single repeat-pass satellite. These two complementary measurement approaches are combined in the single BIOMASS sensor, and have the satisfying property that increasing biomass reduces the sensitivity of the former approach while increasing the sensitivity of the latter. This paper surveys the body of evidence built up over the last decade, from a wide range of airborne experiments, which illustrates the ability of such a sensor to provide the required measurements.At present, the BIOMASS P-band radar appears to be the only sensor capable of providing the necessary global knowledge about the world's forest biomass and its changes. In addition, this first chance to explore the Earth's environment with a long wavelength satellite SAR is expected to make yield new information in a range of geoscience areas, including subsurface structure in arid lands and polar ice, and forest inundation dynamics. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {A common idea is that substituting wood for fossil fuels and energy intensive materials is a better strategy in mitigating climate change than storing more carbon in forests. This opinion remains highly questionable for at least two reasons. Firstly, the carbon footprints of wood-products are underestimated as far as the ``biomass~carbon neutrality'' assumption is involved in their determination, as it is often the case. When taking into account the forest carbon dynamics consecutive to wood harvest, and the limited lifetime of products, these carbon footprints are time-dependent and their presumed values under the carbon neutrality assumption are achieved only in steady-state conditions. Secondly, even if carbon footprints are correctly assessed, the benefit of substitutions is overestimated when all or parts of the wood products are supposed to replace non-wood products whatever the market conditions. Indeed, substitutions are effective only if an increase in wood product consumption implies verifiably a global reduction in non-wood productions. When these flaws in the evaluation of wood substitution effects are avoided, one must conclude that increased harvesting and wood utilization may be counter-productive for climate change mitigation objectives, especially when wood is used as a fuel.},

  abstract = {A model is presented which solves simultaneously for leaf-scale stomatal conductance, CO2 assimilation and the energy balance as a function of leaf position within canopies of well-watered vegetation. Fluxes and conductances were calculated separately for sunlit and shaded leaves. A linear dependence of photosynthetic capacity on leaf nitrogen content was assumed, while leaf nitrogen content and light intensity were assumed to decrease exponentially within canopies. Separate extinction coefficients were used for diffuse and direct beam radiation. An efficient Gaussian integration technique was used to compute fluxes and mean conductances for the canopy. The multilayer model synthesizes current knowledge of radiation penetration, leaf physiology and the physics of evaporation and provides insights into the response of whole canopies to multiple, interacting factors. The model was also used to explore sources of variation in the slopes of two simple parametric models (nitrogen- and light-use efficiency), and to set bounds on the magnitudes of the parameters. For canopies low in total N, daily assimilation rates are {$\sim$}10\% lower when leaf N is distributed uniformly than when the same total N is distributed according to the exponentially decreasing profile of absorbed radiation. However, gains are negligible for plants with high N concentrations. Canopy conductance, Gc should be calculated as Gc=A{$\sigma$}(fslgsl+fshgsh), where {$\Delta$} is leaf area index, fsi and fsh are the fractions of sunlit and shaded leaves at each level, and gsi and gsh are the corresponding stomatal conductances. Simple addition of conductances without this weighting causes errors in transpiration calculated using the `big-leaf' version of the Penman-Monteith equation. Partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat is very responsive to the parameter describing the sensitivity of stomata to the atmospheric humidity deficit. This parameter also affects canopy conductance, but has a relatively small impact on canopy assimilation. Simple parametric models are useful for extrapolating understanding from small to large scales, but the complexity of real ecosystems is thus subsumed in unexplained variations in parameter values. Simulations with the multilayer model show that both nitrogen- and radiation-use efficiencies depend on plant nutritional status and the diffuse component of incident radiation, causing a 2- to 3-fold variation in these efficiencies.

  abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

  abstract = {We used a global vegetation model, 'HyLand', to simulate the effects of changes in climate, CO2 concentration and land use on natural ecosystems. Changes were prescribed by four SRES scenarios: A1f, A2, B1 and B2. Under all SRES scenarios simulated, the terrestrial biosphere is predicted to be a net sink for carbon over practically all of the 21st century. This sink peaks around 2050 and then diminishes rapidly towards the end of the century as a result of climate change. Averaged over the period 1990-2100, the net sink varies between scenarios, from {$\sim$}2 to 6PgCyr-1. Differences are largely the result of differences in CO2 concentrations. Effects of climate change are substantially less, and counteract the effect of elevated CO2. Land use change results in a loss of carbon to the atmosphere in the B2B scenario, in which the increase in cropland area continues. In the other scenarios, there is a decrease in croplands and grassland, with a corresponding increase in natural vegetation, resulting in a net sink to the biosphere. The credibility of these results depends on the accuracy of the predictions of land use change in the SRES scenarios, and these are highly uncertain. As CO2 is the dominating influence on the vegetation, the scenarios with high fossil fuel emissions, and thus the highest CO2 concentrations (A1F \& A2) generate the largest net terrestrial sink for carbon. This conclusion would change if these scenarios assumed continued deforestation and cropland expansion. Without the beneficial effects of elevated CO2, the effects of climate change are much more severe. This is of concern, as the long-term and large-scale effects of elevated CO 2 are still open to question. Differences between scenarios in the predicted global spatial pattern of net biome productivity and vegetation type are relatively small, and there are not major shifts in the dominant types. The regions predicted to be at greatest risk from global environmental change are Amazonia, the Sahel, South Central USA and Central Australia. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Results show that tropical forests have a strong cooling effect throughout the year; temperate forests show moderate cooling in summer and moderate warming in winter with net cooling annually; and boreal forests have strong warming in winter and moderate cooling in summer with net warming annually. The spatiotemporal cooling or warming effects are mainly driven by the two competing biophysical effects, evapotranspiration and albedo, which in turn are strongly influenced by rainfall and snow.

  abstract = {Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) brings major advancements in measuring terrestrial photosynthesis. Several recent studies have evaluated the potential of SIF retrievals from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) in estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) based on GPP data from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers. However, the spatially and temporally sparse nature of OCO-2 data makes it challenging to use these data for many applications from the ecosystem to the global scale. Here, we developed a new global `OCO-2' SIF data set (GOSIF) with high spatial and temporal resolutions (i.e., 0.05{$^\circ$}, 8-day) over the period 2000--2017 based on a data-driven approach. The predictive SIF model was developed based on discrete OCO-2 SIF soundings, remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and meteorological reanalysis data. Our model performed well in estimating SIF (R2 = 0.79, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.07 W m-2 {$\mu$}m-1 sr-1). The model was then used to estimate SIF for each 0.05{$^\circ$} {\texttimes} 0.05{$^\circ$} grid cell and each 8-day interval for the study period. The resulting GOSIF product has reasonable seasonal cycles, and captures the similar seasonality as both the coarse-resolution OCO-2 SIF (1{$^\circ$}), directly aggregated from the discrete OCO-2 soundings, and tower-based GPP. Our SIF estimates are highly correlated with GPP from 91 EC flux sites (R2 = 0.73, p {$<$} 0.001). They capture the expected spatial and temporal patterns and also have remarkable ability to highlight the crop areas with the highest daily productivity across the globe. Our product also allows us to examine the long-term trends in SIF globally. Compared with the coarse-resolution SIF that was directly aggregated from OCO-2 soundings, GOSIF has finer spatial resolution, globally continuous coverage, and a much longer record. Our GOSIF product is valuable for assessing terrestrial photosynthesis and ecosystem function, and benchmarking terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models.},

  abstract = {The frequency and intensity of droughts have increased over the decades, leading to increased forest decline. The response of forest to drought can be evaluated by both its sensitivity to drought (resistance) and its post-drought recovery rate (resilience). However, it remains uncertain how drought resistance and resilience of forests change over time under climate change. We assessed the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest resistance and resilience to drought over the past century (1901--2015) with global tree ring data records from 2,935 sites, in conjunction with plant trait data. We found that gymnosperms and angiosperms showed different spatial patterns of drought resistance and resilience, driven by variations in eco-physiological traits. Resistance and resilience also varied with drought seasonal timing. Surprisingly, we found that the trade-off between resistance and resilience for gymnosperms, previously reported only spatially, also occurred at the temporal scale. In particular, drought resilience markedly increased, but resistance decreased, for gymnosperms between 1950--1969 and 1990--2009, indicating that previous model simulations assuming invariant resistance may have underestimated the impacts of drought on gymnosperm-dominated forests under future climate change.},

  abstract = {Most scenarios from integrated assessment models (IAMs) that project greenhouse gas emissions include the use of bioenergy as a means to reduce CO2 emissions or even to achieve negative emissions (together with CCS carbon capture and storage). The potential amount of CO2 that can be removed from the atmosphere depends, among others, on the yields of bioenergy crops, the land available to grow these crops and the efficiency with which CO2 produced by combustion is captured. While bioenergy crop yields can be simulated by models, estimates of the spatial distribution of bioenergy yields under current technology based on a large number of observations are currently lacking. In this study, a random-forest (RF) algorithm is used to upscale a bioenergy yield dataset of 3963 observations covering Miscanthus, switchgrass, eucalypt, poplar and willow using climatic and soil conditions as explanatory variables. The results are global yield maps of five important lignocellulosic bioenergy crops under current technology, climate and atmospheric CO2 conditions at a 0:5 0:5 spatial resolution. We also provide a combined "best bioenergy crop" yield map by selecting one of the five crop types with the highest yield in each of the grid cells, eucalypt and Miscanthus in most cases. The global median yield of the best crop is 16.3 tDMha1 yr1 (DM dry matter). High yields mainly occur in the Amazon region and southeastern Asia. We further compare our empirically derived maps with yield maps used in three IAMs and find that the median yields in our maps are 50\% higher than those in the IAM maps. Our estimates of gridded bioenergy crop yields can be used to provide bioenergy yields for IAMs, to evaluate land surface models or to identify the most suitable lands for future bioenergy crop plantations.

The treatments included (1) one-time application of C6 in March (B-C6); (2) one-time application of C6 in October (H-C6); (3) one-time application of 50\% C3 and 50\% C6 in March (B-(50C3 + 50C6)); (4) one-time application of 70\% C3 and 30\% C6 in March (B-(70C3 + 30C6)); (5) common compound fertilizer (CCF) with one-time application of CCF in March (B-CCF); and (6) common compound fertilizer with three-time application of CCF in March, June, and October (CT). The index of apple yield, apple tree growth index, fruit quality, and soil nutrient status were evaluated in 2-year filed production system. The results indicated that the treatment of B-(50C3 + 50C6) significantly improved the growth of apple trees on trunk diameter, plant height, new shoot growth and chlorophyll content, and the apple yield increased by 8.82\%. By comprehensive comparison of yield, soil nutrients, and fruit tree growth indexes, the treatment with (B-(50C3 + 50C6)) was considered to be the best controlled-release fertilizer application method.},

  abstract = {We summarize the documented and potential impacts of salvage logging - a form of logging that removes trees and other biological material from sites after natural disturbance. Such operations may reduce or eliminate biological legacies, modify rare postdisturbance habitats, influence populations, alter community composition, impair natural vegetation recovery, facilitate the colonization of invasive species, alter soil properties and nutrient levels, increase erosion, modify hydrological regimes and aquatic ecosystems, and alter patterns of landscape heterogeneity. These impacts can be assigned to three broad and interrelated effects: (1) altered stand structural complexity; (2) altered ecosystem processes and functions; and (3) altered populations of species and community composition. Some impacts may be different from or additional to the effects of traditional logging that is not preceded by a large natural disturbance because the conditions before, during, and after salvage logging may differ from those that characterize traditional timber harvesting. The potential impacts of salvage logging often have been overlooked, partly because the processes of ecosystem recovery after natural disturbance are still poorly understood and partly because potential cumulative effects of natural and human disturbance have not been well documented. Ecologically informed policies regarding salvage logging are needed prior to major natural disturbances so that when they occur ad hoc and crisis-mode decision making can be avoided. These policies should lead to salvage-exemption zones and limits on the amounts of disturbance-derived biological legacies (e.g., burned trees, logs) that are removed where salvage logging takes place. Finally, we believe new terminology is needed. The word salvage implies that something is being saved or recovered, whereas from an ecological perspective this is rarely the case. {\copyright}2006 Society for Conservation Biology.},

This extension of the growing season has been associated with recent global warming. Changes in the timing and length of the growing season (GSL) may not only have far reaching consequences for plant and animal ecosystems, but persistent increases in GSL may lead to long-term increases in carbon storage and changes in vegetation cover which may affect the climate system.

  abstract = {Abstract. Global forests are the main component of the land carbon sink, which acts as a partial buffer to CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Dynamic vegetation models offer an approach to projecting the development of forest carbon sink capacity in a future climate. Forest management capabilities are important to include in dynamic vegetation models to account for the effects of age and species structure and wood harvest on carbon stocks and carbon storage potential. This article describes the implementation of a forest management module containing even-age and clear-cut and uneven-age and continuous-cover management alternatives in the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Different age and species structure initialisation strategies and harvest alternatives are introduced. The model is applied at stand and European scales. Different management alternatives are applied in simulations of European beech (Fagus sylvaticus) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) even-aged monoculture stands in central Europe and evaluated against above-ground standing stem volume and harvested volume data from long-term experimental plots. At the European scale, an automated thinning and clear-cut strategy is applied. Modelled carbon stocks and fluxes are evaluated against reported data at the continent and country levels. Including wood harvest in regrowth forests increases the simulated total European carbon sink by 32 \% in 1991--2015 and improves the fit to the reported European carbon sink, growing stock, and net annual increment (NAI). Growing stock (156 m3 ha-1) and NAI (5.4 m3 ha1 yr1) densities in 2010 are close to reported values, while the carbon sink density in 2000--2007 (0.085 kg C m-2 yr1) equates to 63 \% of reported values, most likely reflecting uncertainties in carbon fluxes from soil given the unaccounted for forest land-use history in the simulations. The fit of modelled and reported values for individual European countries varies, but NAI is generally closer to reported values when including wood harvest in simulations.},

  abstract = {This study compiles and summarizes the existing knowledge about observed and projected impacts of climate change on forests in Europe. Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and floods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short-medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and fire risks. Adaptive capacity consists of the inherent adaptive capacity of trees and forest ecosystems and of socio-economic factors determining the capability to implement planned adaptation. The adaptive capacity in the forest sector is relatively large in the Boreal and the Temperate Oceanic regions, more constrained by socio-economic factors in the Temperate Continental, and most limited in the Mediterranean region where large forest areas are only extensively managed or unmanaged. Potential impacts and risks are best studied and understood with respect to wood production. It is clear that all other goods and services provided by European forests will also be impacted by climate change, but much less knowledge is available to quantify these impacts. Understanding of adaptive capacity and regional vulnerability to climate change in European forests is not well developed and requires more focussed research efforts. An interdisciplinary research agenda integrated with monitoring networks and projection models is needed to provide information at all levels of decision making, from policy development to the management unit. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The knowledge about potential climate change impacts on forests is continuously expanding and some changes in growth, drought induced mortality and species distribution have been observed. However despite a significant body of research, a knowledge and communication gap exists between scientists and non-scientists as to how climate change impact scenarios can be interpreted and what they imply for European forests. It is still challenging to advise forest decision makers on how best to plan for climate change as many uncertainties and unknowns remain and it is difficult to communicate these to practitioners and other decision makers while retaining emphasis on the importance of planning for adaptation. In this paper, recent developments in climate change observations and projections, observed and projected impacts on European forests and the associated uncertainties are reviewed and synthesised with a view to understanding the implications for forest management. Current impact assessments with simulation models contain several simplifications, which explain the discrepancy between results of many simulation studies and the rapidly increasing body of evidence about already observed changes in forest productivity and species distribution. In simulation models uncertainties tend to cascade onto one another; from estimating what future societies will be like and general circulation models (GCMs) at the global level, down to forest models and forest management at the local level. Individual climate change impact studies should not be uncritically used for decision-making without reflection on possible shortcomings in system understanding, model accuracy and other assumptions made. It is important for decision makers in forest management to realise that they have to take long-lasting management decisions while uncertainty about climate change impacts are still large. We discuss how to communicate about uncertainty - which is imperative for decision making - without diluting the overall message. Considering the range of possible trends and uncertainties in adaptive forest management requires expert knowledge and enhanced efforts for providing science-based decision support. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

To achieve those goals we ultimately need to define ecosystem overfishing in a way that is analogous to the concept used in single-species management. Ecosystem-based control rules can then be formulated when various ecosystem indicators are evaluated with respect to fishing-induced changes. However, these multi-attribute control rules will be less straightforward than those applied typically in single-species management, and may represent a gradient rather than binary decision criteria. Some ecosystem-based decision criteria are suggested, based on indicators empirically derived from the Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine ecosystem. Further development in the translation of ecosystem indicators into decision criteria is one of the major areas for progress in fisheries science and management.},

  abstract = {Vegetation change plays a critical role in the Earth's carbon (C) budget and its associated radiative forcing in response to anthropogenic and natural climate change. Existing global estimates of aboveground biomass carbon (ABC) based on field survey data provide brief snapshots that are mainly limited to forest ecosystems. Here we use an entirely new remote sensing approach to derive global ABC estimates for both forest and non-forest biomes during the past two decades from satellite passive microwave observations. We estimate a global average ABC of 362 PgC over the period 1998-2002, of which 65\% is in forests and 17\% in savannahs. Over the period 1993-2012, an estimated '0.07 PgC yr '1 ABC was lost globally, mostly resulting from the loss of tropical forests ('0.26 PgC yr '1) and net gains in mixed forests over boreal and temperate regions (+0.13 PgC yr '1) and tropical savannahs and shrublands (+0.05 PgC yr '1). Interannual ABC patterns are greatly influenced by the strong response of water-limited ecosystems to rainfall variability, particularly savannahs. From 2003 onwards, forest in Russia and China expanded and tropical deforestation declined. Increased ABC associated with wetter conditions in the savannahs of northern Australia and southern Africa reversed global ABC loss, leading to an overall gain, consistent with trends in the global carbon sink reported in recent studies.},

On current trends, the probability of staying below 2 {$^\circ$}C of warming is only 5\%, but if all countries meet their nationally determined contributions and continue to reduce emissions at the same rate after 2030, it rises to 26\%. If the USA alone does not meet its nationally determined contribution, it declines to 18\%. To have an even chance of staying below 2 {$^\circ$}C, the average rate of decline in emissions would need to increase from the 1\% per year needed to meet the nationally determined contributions, to 1.8\% per year.},

It explores the collapse of socialist governance and management systems on land cover and land use in various parts of Eastern Europe. As readers will discover, this involved rapid and unprecedented changes such as widespread agricultural abandonment. Changes in the countries of the former Soviet block, former Soviet Union republics, and European Russia are compared and contrasted. Contributing authors cover topics such as the carbon cycle and the environment, effects of institutional changes on urban centers and agriculture, as well as changes in wildlife populations. The volume includes analysis of the drivers of agricultural land abandonment, forest changes in Black Sea region, an extreme drought event of 2010, impacts of fires on air quality and other land-cover/land-use issues in Eastern Europe. Satellite data used were mostly from optical sensors including night lights observations, with both coarse and medium spatial resolution. Ultimately, this work highlights the importance of understanding socioeconomic shocks: that is, those brief periods during which societies change rapidly resulting in significant impact on land use and the environment. Thus it shows that change is often abrupt rather than gradual and thereby much harder to predict. This book is a truly international and interdisciplinary effort, written by a team of scientists from the USA, Europe, and Russia. It will be of interest to a broad range of scientists at all levels within natural and social sciences, including those studying recent and ongoing changes in Europe. In particular, it will appeal to geographers, environmental scientists, remote sensing specialists, social scientists and agricultural scientists.},

Samp.] and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensisMill.) as the chief beneficiaries of the anticipated environmental shifts, whereas other oak species and conifers suffer a decline. Context: The ten most important tree species (five oaks and five conifers) in Southern Spain were selected for the study. The study area, corresponding to the region of Andalusia, is located in an interesting position between Central European and North African climates. The territory also exhibits the most extreme patterns of rainfall in the Iberian Peninsula. Aims: This study aims to model the potential distribution of the ten species in response to climate change, in several time periods, including the present and two future twenty-first century dates. Methods: The potential distributions within the different scenarios were simulated using logistic regression techniques based on a set of 19 climate variables from the WorldClim 1.4 project. The scenarios were drawn from the RCP 2.6 and 6.0 in the CCSM4 Global Circulation Model. The resolution of the output maps was 30 arc-seconds. Results: The simulation predicted increased distribution areas for Q. ilex and P. halepensis under the four future scenarios as compared to present. The eight remaining taxa suffered a severe retraction in potential distribution. Conclusion: Global climate change is likely to have a significant impact on forest dynamics in southern Spain. Only two species would benefit to the detriment of the others. Logistic Regression is identified as a robust method for carrying out management and conservation programmes.},

  abstract = {In Sweden, where forests cover more than 60\% of the land area, silviculture and the use of forest products by industry and society play crucial roles in the national carbon balance. A scientific challenge is to understand how different forest management and wood use strategies can best contribute to climate change mitigation benefits. This study uses a set of models to analyze the effects of different forest management and wood use strategies in Sweden on carbon dioxide emissions and removals through 2105. If the present Swedish forest use strategy is continued, the long-term climate change mitigation benefit will correspond to more than 60 million tons of avoided or reduced emissions of carbon dioxide annually, compared to a scenario with similar consumption patterns in society but where non-renewable products are used instead of forest-based products. On average about 470 kg of carbon dioxide emissions are avoided for each cubic meter of biomass harvested, after accounting for carbon stock changes, substitution effects and all emissions related to forest management and industrial processes. Due to Sweden's large export share of forest-based products, the climate change mitigation effect of Swedish forestry is larger abroad than within the country. The study also shows that silvicultural methods to increase forest biomass production can further reduce net carbon dioxide emissions by an additional 40 million tons of per year. Forestry's contribution to climate change mitigation could be significantly increased if management of the boreal forest were oriented towards increased biomass production and if more wood were used to substitute fossil fuels and energy-intensive materials. {\copyright} 2014 by the authors.},

The Betula pubescens Ehrh. and B. pendula Roth studied included intact trees, trees that had been coppiced 8 years earlier, trees coppiced at the beginning of the experimental season, and birches that had been coppiced twice, 8 years earlier and at the beginning of the experimental season. Carbohydrate accumulation differed between 8 years earlier coppiced and intact trees. Recent coppicing clearly decreased the starch and sugar concentrations of the roots, which were often highest in the thin roots. The concentrations of these compounds in the stumps were always low, although the carbohydrate concentrations of stumps, in particular, correlated with shoot regeneration capacity. Starch was the most labile of the carbohydrates measured and most clearly reacted to coppicing. Differences in starch- and sugar-reserve dynamics indicate a difference between these birch species in the use and replenishing of root and stump reserves. This information may also be of help when the effects of other stresses, for example, severe animal damage or burning, on the regrowth of young birch stands are estimated. {\copyright} Springer 2005.},

  abstract = {Aim: To examine the contribution of large-diameter trees to biomass, stand structure, and species richness across forest biomes. Location: Global. Time period: Early 21st century. Major taxa studied: Woody plants. Methods: We examined the contribution of large trees to forest density, richness and biomass using a global network of 48 large (from 2 to 60 ha) forest plots representing 5,601,473 stems across 9,298 species and 210 plant families. This contribution was assessed using three metrics: the largest 1\% of trees {$\geq~$}1 cm diameter at breast height (DBH), all trees {$\geq~$}60 cm DBH, and those rank-ordered largest trees that cumulatively comprise 50\% of forest biomass. Results: Averaged across these 48 forest plots, the largest 1\% of trees {$\geq~$}1 cm DBH comprised 50\% of aboveground live biomass, with hectare-scale standard deviation of 26\%. Trees {$\geq~$}60 cm DBH comprised 41\% of aboveground live tree biomass. The size of the largest trees correlated with total forest biomass (r2 =.62, p {$<$}.001). Large-diameter trees in high biomass forests represented far fewer species relative to overall forest richness (r2 =.45, p {$<$}.001). Forests with more diverse large-diameter tree communities were comprised of smaller trees (r2 =.33, p {$<$}.001). Lower large-diameter richness was associated with large-diameter trees being individuals of more common species (r2 =.17, p =.002). The concentration of biomass in the largest 1\% of trees declined with increasing absolute latitude (r2 =.46, p {$<$}.001), as did forest density (r2 =.31, p {$<$}.001). Forest structural complexity increased with increasing absolute latitude (r2 =.26, p {$<$}.001). Main conclusions: Because large-diameter trees constitute roughly half of the mature forest biomass worldwide, their dynamics and sensitivities to environmental change represent potentially large controls on global forest carbon cycling. We recommend managing forests for conservation of existing large-diameter trees or those that can soon reach large diameters as a simple way to conserve and potentially enhance ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Old-growth forests remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at rates that vary with climate and nitrogen deposition. The sequestered carbon dioxide is stored in live woody tissues and slowly decomposing organic matter in litter and soil. Old-growth forests therefore serve as a global carbon dioxide sink, but they are not protected by international treaties, because it is generally thought that ageing forests cease to accumulate carbon. Here we report a search of literature and databases for forest carbon-flux estimates. We find that in forests between 15 and 800 years of age, net ecosystem productivity (the net carbon balance of the forest including soils) is usually positive. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forests can continue to accumulate carbon, contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral. Over 30 per cent of the global forest area is unmanaged primary forest, and this area contains the remaining old-growth forests. Half of the primary forests (6 {\texttimes} 10 8 hectares) are located in the boreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. On the basis of our analysis, these forests alone sequester about 1.3 {\textpm} 0.5 gigatonnes of carbon per year. Thus, our findings suggest that 15 per cent of the global forest area, which is currently not considered when offsetting increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, provides at least 10 per cent of the global net ecosystem productivity. Old-growth forests accumulate carbon for centuries and contain large quantities of it.

  abstract = {The Paris Agreement promotes forest management as a pathway towards halting climate warming through the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions 1 . However, the climate benefits from carbon sequestration through forest management may be reinforced, counteracted or even offset by concurrent management-induced changes in surface albedo, land-surface roughness, emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, transpiration and sensible heat flux 2--4 . Consequently, forest management could offset CO 2 emissions without halting global temperature rise. It therefore remains to be confirmed whether commonly proposed sustainable European forest-management portfolios would comply with the Paris Agreement---that is, whether they can reduce the growth rate of atmospheric CO 2 , reduce the radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere, and neither increase the near-surface air temperature nor decrease precipitation by the end of the twenty-first century. Here we show that the portfolio made up of management systems that locally maximize the carbon sink through carbon sequestration, wood use and product and energy substitution reduces the growth rate of atmospheric CO 2 , but does not meet any of the other criteria. The portfolios that maximize the carbon sink or forest albedo pass only one---different in each case---criterion. Managing the European forests with the objective of reducing near-surface air temperature, on the other hand, will also reduce the atmospheric CO 2 growth rate, thus meeting two of the four criteria. Trade-off are thus unavoidable when using European forests to meet climate objectives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that if present-day forest cover is sustained, the additional climate benefits achieved through forest management would be modest and local, rather than global. On the basis of these findings, we argue that Europe should not rely on forest management to mitigate climate change. The modest climate effects from changes in forest management imply, however, that if adaptation to future climate were to require large-scale changes in species composition and silvicultural systems over Europe 5,6 , the forests could be adapted to climate change with neither positive nor negative climate effects.},

  abstract = {Cities import energy, which in combination with their typically high solar absorption and low moisture availability generates the urban heat island effect (UHI). The UHI, combined with human-induced warming, makes our densely populated cities particularly vulnerable to climate change. We examine the utility of solar photovoltaic (PV) system deployment on urban rooftops to reduce the UHI, and we price one potential value of this impact. The installation of PV systems over Sydney, Australia reduces summer maximum temperatures by up to 1{$^\circ$}C because the need to import energy is offset by local generation. This offset has a direct environmental benefit, cooling local maximum temperatures, but also a direct economic value in the energy generated. The indirect benefit associated with the temperature changes is between net AUD\$230,000 and \$3,380,000 depending on the intensity of PV systems deployment. Therefore, even very large PV installations will not offset global warming, but could generate enough energy to negate the need to import energy, and thereby reduce air temperatures. The energy produced, and the benefits of cooling beyond local PV installation sites, would reduce the vulnerability of urban populations and infrastructure to temperature extremes.},

  abstract = {T he extent and distribution of carbon storage in plants is central to our understanding of the structure and function of the terrestrial biosphere 1,2. At present, our understanding of global plant biomass stems primarily from satellite and inventory data that characterize the aboveground components of ecosystems 1,3-6. However, a major component of plant biomass cannot be detected by satellites or direct aboveground observations because it exists belowground as roots, which are central to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems 7 and greatly affect ecosystem nutrient, water and carbon cycling 8-11. Plant investment in root biomass has generally been explored using local-scale observations 12,13 , such that variation at regional and global scales remains unknown. Without empirical, spatially explicit models of the relative proportion of plant biomass distributed to roots (root-mass fraction, RMF), aboveground bio-mass cannot be adequately scaled to total plant biomass 6,14,15. At the global scale, patterns of biomass fractions in roots, wood and leaves are expected to reflect a functional balance between the distribution of resources that exist above (light, CO 2) and below (water, nutrient) the soil surface 16,17. Indeed, plants tend to show proportionally higher biomass allocation to roots when below-ground resources are scarce 16-20. Because belowground limitations should be most pronounced in cold regions (where nutrient supply is low) and in dry environments 13,21-23 , RMFs are expected to increase with latitude 24 and in arid regions with low water availability 13,22. Given such relationships, changing climate and associated shifts in above-versus belowground resource availability may alter relative plant investments in root biomass. Due to large variations in the longevity of different plant tissues, such shifts drive feedbacks between climate and the terrestrial carbon cycle 25. Yet, despite the central role of biomass allocation in shaping vegetation responses to altered environmental conditions, we lack a quantitative, spatially explicit understanding of the factors driving RMF 13,19,26 , which is essential for improving confidence in future carbon cycle projections 25. Characterizing the environmental drivers of the variation in RMF across the globe is thus critical for projecting plant biomass accumulation 23 , productivity 27 and nutrient cycling 11 under current or future climate change scenarios 6. Here we use a large dataset of plant RMFs to generate a spatially explicit understanding of the proportional plant biomass that exists in roots and upscale these predictions to the globe to quantify total belowground plant biomass. First, we constructed a database of 17,814 plot-level RMF measurements, aggregated to 6,803 spatially distinct samples from forest (n = 5,170), grassland (n = 1,293), and shrubland (n = 340) vegetation (Fig. 1). Using 63 global layers of climate , topography, soil and vegetation features (Extended Data Fig. 1), we then trained random forest models to characterize the environmental factors that drive geographic variations in RMFs within each vegetation type and interpolate these relationships across the globe. To comprehend the interactive mechanisms that have ultimately shaped variations in biomass partitioning within and across regions, we additionally use recursive partitioning and regression methods accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Finally, we compare our empirical RMF data with vegetation model simulations to pinpoint important deviations in model predictions versus observed biomass fractions. There was considerable variation in RMF within each vegetation type (Fig. 2a-c), which can rival the amount of variation observed across types. Within forests, the highest RMFs are found in boreal regions and seasonally dry tropical and subtropical regions, such as the Mediterranean region, east Brazil, California, and Southern Africa (Fig. 3a). Within grasslands, RMFs in tropical areas are, on average, {\textasciitilde}50\% lower than in temperate environments, and the A poor understanding of the fraction of global plant biomass occurring belowground as roots limits our understanding of present and future ecosystem function and carbon pools. Here we create a database of root-mass fractions (RMFs), an index of plant below-versus aboveground biomass distributions, and generate quantitative, spatially explicit global maps of RMFs in trees, shrubs and grasses. Our analyses reveal large gradients in RMFs both across and within vegetation types that can be attributed to resource availability. High RMFs occur in cold and dry ecosystems, while low RMFs dominate in warm and wet regions. Across all vegetation types, the directional effect of temperature on RMFs depends on water availability, suggesting feedbacks between heat, water and nutrient supply. By integrating our RMF maps with existing aboveground plant biomass information, we estimate that in forests, shrublands and grasslands, respectively, 22\%, 47\% and 67\% of plant biomass exists belowground, with a total global belowground fraction of 24\% (20-28\%), that is, 113 (90-135) Gt carbon. By documenting the environmental correlates of root biomass allocation, our results can inform model projections of global vegetation dynamics under current and future climate scenarios.

  abstract = {Abstract. The Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC) is the change in global mean temperature expected to occur following the cessation of net CO2 emissions and as such is a critical parameter for calculating the remaining carbon budget. The Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP) was established to gain a better understanding of the potential magnitude and sign of ZEC, in addition to the processes that underlie this metric. A total of 18 Earth system models of both full and intermediate complexity participated in ZECMIP. All models conducted an experiment where atmospheric CO2 concentration increases exponentially until 1000 PgC has been emitted. Thereafter emissions are set to zero and models are configured to allow free evolution of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Many models conducted additional second-priority simulations with different cumulative emission totals and an alternative idealized emissions pathway with a gradual transition to zero emissions. The inter-model range of ZEC 50 years after emissions cease for the 1000 PgC experiment is -0.36 to 0.29 {$\circ$}C, with a model ensemble mean of -0.07 {$\circ$}C, median of -0.05 {$\circ$}C, and standard deviation of 0.19 {$\circ$}C. Models exhibit a wide variety of behaviours after emissions cease, with some models continuing to warm for decades to millennia and others cooling substantially. Analysis shows that both the carbon uptake by the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere are important for counteracting the warming effect from the reduction in ocean heat uptake in the decades after emissions cease. This warming effect is difficult to constrain due to high uncertainty in the efficacy of ocean heat uptake. Overall, the most likely value of ZEC on multi-decadal timescales is close to zero, consistent with previous model experiments and simple theory.},

  abstract = {Given the short time-frame to limit global warming, and the current emissions gap, it is critical to prioritise mitigation actions. To date, scant attention has been paid to the mitigation benefits of primary forest protection. We estimated tropical forest ecosystem carbon stocks and flows. The ecosystem carbon stock of primary tropical forests is estimated at 141--159 Pg C (billion tonnes of carbon) which is some 49--53\% of all tropical forest carbon, the living biomass component of which alone is 91--103\% of the remaining carbon budget to limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Furthermore, tropical forests have ongoing sequestration rates 0.47--1.3 Pg C yr-1, equivalent to 8--13\% of annual global anthropogenic CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. We examined three main forest-based strategies used in the land sector---halting deforestation, increasing forest restoration and improving the sustainable management of production forests. The mitigation benefits of primary forest protection are contingent upon how degradation is defined and accounted for, while those from restoration also depend on how restoration is understood and applied. Through proforestation, reduced carbon stocks in secondary forests can regrow to their natural carbon carrying capacity or primary forest state. We evaluated published data from studies comparing logged and unlogged forests. On average, primary forests store around 35\% more carbon. While comparisons are confounded by a range of factors, reported biomass carbon recovery rates were from 40 to 100+ years. There is a substantive portfolio of forest-based mitigation actions and interventions available to policy and decision-makers, depending on national circumstances, in addition to SFM and plantation focused approaches, that can be grouped into four main strategies: protection; proforestation, reforestation and restoration; reform of guidelines, accounting rules and default values; landscape conservation planning. Given the emissions gap, mitigation strategies that merely reduce the rate of emissions against historic or projected reference levels are insufficient. Mitigation strategies are needed that explicitly avoid emissions where possible as well as enabling ongoing sequestration.},

The unprecedented availability of data streams describing different facets of the Earth now offers fundamentally new avenues to address this quest. However, several practical hurdles, especially the lack of data interoperability, limit the joint potential of these data streams. Today many initiatives within and beyond the Earth system sciences are exploring new approaches to overcome these hurdles and meet the growing inter-disciplinary need for data-intensive research; using data cubes is one promising avenue. Here, we introduce the concept of Earth system data cubes and how to operate on them in a formal way. The idea is that treating multiple data dimensions, such as spatial, temporal, variable, frequency and other grids alike, allows effective application of user-defined functions to co-interpret Earth observations and/or model-data. An implementation of this concept combines analysis-ready data cubes with a suitable analytic interface. In three case studies we demonstrate how the concept and its implementation facilitate the execution of complex workflows for research across multiple variables, spatial and temporal scales: (1) summary statistics for ecosystem and climate dynamics; (2) intrinsic dimensionality analysis on multiple time-scales; and (3) data-model integration. We discuss the emerging perspectives for investigating global interacting and coupled phenomena in observed or simulated data. Latest developments in machine learning, causal inference, and model data integration can be seamlessly implemented in the proposed framework, supporting rapid progress in data-intensive research across disciplinary boundaries.},

  abstract = {Forest ecosystems provide a range of goods and services that are essential to human well-being. Yet global environmental problems, increasing urbanization, industrialization pressures, and dominant market mechanisms put into jeopardy the long term sustainable provision of forest ecosystem services (FES). Markets tend to favor private goods, such as timber, and are typically less able to provide sustainable financing mechanisms for public goods and services, such as carbon storage, biodiversity conservation or recreational value. European forest owners and policy makers alike are looking for governance innovations that generate economic opportunity while ensuring the future provision of FES. This systematic literature review aims to consolidate existing academic empirical research on local or regional level governance innovations in Europe concerned with generating forest-based revenue through FES provision. Thus, it complements conceptual literature dealing with challenges and opportunities of financing the provision of FES. When conducting the review we followed the process guidelines developed by `Collaboration for Environmental Evidence' (Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, 2018). Out of a total of 3962 scanned papers, 23 papers containing 48 case studies were identified and analyzed in detail, to address the following guiding questions: (1) What types of FES related (governance) innovations for forest-based revenue generation exist and which FES do they address? (2) What are the motivations driving innovation development? (3) What are the implications for forest management? We found four types of governance innovations: forest product and organizational innovations which largely relate to provisioning FES; service innovations, which generally relate to cultural FES; and financial incentive systems or payment schemes targeting mostly regulating services. We identify potential synergies between two high-priority EU policy objectives: rural economic development and securing future FES provision. Currently, governance innovations' forest management implications and associated impact on (future) FES provision are rarely addressed in this literature. We recommend future policy and research to give greater consideration to the interdependencies between securing a range of FES, (rural) economic development, and forest management, to realize potential synergies.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Forest ecosystems are already responding to changing environmental conditions that are driven by increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These developments affect how societies can utilise and benefit from the woodland areas in the future, be it for example climate change mitigation as carbon sinks, lumber for wood industry, or preserved for nature tourism and recreational activities. We assess the effect and the relative magnitude of different uncertainty sources in ecosystem model simulations from the year 1980 to 2100 for two Finnish boreal forest sites. The models used in this study are the land ecosystem model JSBACH and the forest growth model PREBAS. The considered uncertainty sources for both models are model parameters and four prescribed climates with two RCP (representative concentration pathway) scenarios. Usually, model parameter uncertainty is not included in these types of uncertainty studies. PREBAS simulations also include two forest management scenarios. We assess the effect of these sources of variation at four different points in time on several ecosystem indicators, e.g. gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration, soil moisture, recurrence of drought, length of the vegetation active period (VAP), length of the snow melting period and the stand volume. The uncertainty induced by the climate models remains roughly the same throughout the simulations and is overtaken by the RCP scenario impact halfway through the experiment. The management actions are the most dominant uncertainty factors for Hyyti{\"a}l{\"a} and as important as RCP scenarios at the end of the simulations, but they contribute only half as much for Sodankyl{\"a}. The parameter uncertainty is the least influential of the examined uncertainty sources, but it is also the most elusive to estimate due to non-linear and adverse effects on the simulated ecosystem indicators. Our analysis underlines the importance of carefully considering the implementation of forest use when simulating future ecosystem conditions, as human impact is evident and even increasing in boreal forested regions.},

The method of the wood resource balance is introduced, with its basic elements of resource monitoring, bottom-up approach, data counterchecking and conversion factors. The method is applicable for manifold research topics. This is shown in three examples. The wood flow analysis represents a total resource assessment including all wood products in all process steps from forest to disposal. Based on the wood flow analysis, calculation schemes show how cascading factors can be calculated on a constant basis.

  abstract = {Mountain forest dynamics and ecosystems services are critically influenced by disturbances, in particular storm events. After extensive disturbance, the large amount of deadwood lying on ground and the necessity for restoring the forest cover with natural regeneration are two critical issues to be dealt with. Salvage logging is the most common post-disturbance management strategy, but it does not consider the strategic role of coarse woody debris (CWD) in favoring regeneration establishment and survival. The aim of this study is to analyze how CWD contributes to creating favorable microsites for regeneration, increasing seedling establishment probability, after a large windthrow in the eastern Italian Alps. We focused on two different facilitative mechanisms provided by CWD, microsite amelioration and seedling protection, by planting a set of seedlings in the surroundings of deadwood elements. The former mechanism was analyzed by measuring temperature and SWC (Soil Water Content) locally, while for the latter we recorded evidence of browsing at the end of the season. For each trial, we established control sites in empty areas nearby with no CWD presence in order to infer its contribution. The results show that north-facing microsites on south-exposed slopes offer significantly lower temperature and fewer water stress for saplings, in comparison to south-facing microsites. More in general, saplings on deadwood-mitigated microsites are less exposed to desiccation, which mitigates the transplanting shock and facilitates the establishment. Moreover, the presence of lying deadwood increases roughness and, as a consequence, the cost for browsers to reach the seedlings. Using a coefficient expressing this increment, we underline the significant protective effect of CWD against deer browsing. The results of our study highlight the importance of deadwood in providing favorable regeneration microsites, enhancing the probability of sapling establishment and survival, protecting them from deer browsing.},

A fundamental assumption of bias correction is that the considered climate model produces skillful input for a bias correction, including a plausible representation of climate change. Current bias correction methods cannot plausibly correct climate change trends, and have limited ability to downscale. Cross validation of marginal aspects is not sufficient to evaluate bias correction and needs to be complemented by further analyses. Future research should address the development of stochastic models for downscaling and approaches to explicitly incorporate process understanding.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) is a set of algorithms dedicated to the estimation of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture from satellite data. Ever since its development in 2011, the model has been regularly revised, aiming at the optimal incorporation of new satellite-observed geophysical variables, and improving the representation of physical processes. In this study, the next version of this model (v3) is presented. Key changes relative to the previous version include (1) a revised formulation of the evaporative stress, (2) an optimized drainage algorithm, and (3) a new soil moisture data assimilation system. GLEAM v3 is used to produce three new data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture, including a 36-year data set spanning 1980--2015, referred to as v3a (based on satellite-observed soil moisture, vegetation optical depth and snow-water equivalent, reanalysis air temperature and radiation, and a multi-source precipitation product), and two satellite-based data sets. The latter share most of their forcing, except for the vegetation optical depth and soil moisture, which are based on observations from different passive and active C- and L-band microwave sensors (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative, ESA CCI) for the v3b data set (spanning 2003--2015) and observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite in the v3c data set (spanning 2011--2015). Here, these three data sets are described in detail, compared against analogous data sets generated using the previous version of GLEAM (v2), and validated against measurements from 91 eddy-covariance towers and 2325 soil moisture sensors across a broad range of ecosystems. Results indicate that the quality of the v3 soil moisture is consistently better than the one from v2: average correlations against in situ surface soil moisture measurements increase from 0.61 to 0.64 in the case of the v3a data set and the representation of soil moisture in the second layer improves as well, with correlations increasing from 0.47 to 0.53. Similar improvements are observed for the v3b and c data sets. Despite regional differences, the quality of the evaporation fluxes remains overall similar to the one obtained using the previous version of GLEAM, with average correlations against eddy-covariance measurements ranging between 0.78 and 0.81 for the different data sets. These global data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture are now openly available at www.GLEAM.eu and may be used for large-scale hydrological applications, climate studies, or research on land--atmosphere feedbacks.},

Available data on wood chemical traits are based largely on samples taken from main stems; few studies have evaluated how wood chemical traits vary among major woody tissue types. We examined variation in wood carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in 17 temperate tree species across five woody tissue types: sapwood, heartwood, small branches, coarse roots, and bark; analyses were corrected for losses of volatile C. Both C and N varied significantly among tissue types, but differences were driven mainly by high C and N in bark, a pattern observed for nearly all species. Among nonbark tissue types, bivariate correlations among sapwood, heartwood, small branches, and coarse roots were highly significant and positive for wood C (r = 0.88--0.98) and N (r = 0.66--0.95) concentrations. We suggest that intraspecific variation in C across tissue types is less important than interspecific variation for assessment and modeling of forest-level C dynamics. In contrast, differences in N among tissue types were larger and appeared to be more important to incorporate into forest-level nutrient assessments and models. Our results suggest that, with the exception of bark, wood chemical trait values derived from stemwood can be used to accurately represent whole-tree trait values in models of forest C and N stocks and fluxes, at least for temperate species.},

Samp. and Juniperus phoenicea L. displayed declines in midday g(s) and {$\Psi$}(s). The higher resistance to CO2 influx in needles of P. halepensis compared with the other species did not result in either a proportional increase in non-radiative dissipation of excess energy or photo-inactivation of photosystem II (PSII). No significant differences were found among species either in the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle (DPS) or in the pool of its components on a total chlorophyll basis (VAZ). Despite contrasting midday assimilation rates, the three drought-tolerant species all exhibited a pronounced drop in photochemical efficiency at midday that was characterized by a decrease in the excitation capture efficiency of the open PSII centers. Although photoinhibition was not fully reversed before dawn, it apparently did not result in cumulative photo-damage. Thus, the drought-avoiding and drought-tolerant species employed different mechanisms for coping with excess light during the midday depression in photosynthesis that involved contrasting midday photochemical efficiencies of PSII and different degrees of dynamic photoinhibition as a photo-protective mechanism. These behaviors may be related to the different mechanisms employed by drought-avoiding and drought-tolerant species to withstand water deficit.},

We synthesize the degree to which the peer-reviewed ecosystem services literature has captured these steps. For the ecosystem service paradigm to gain traction in science and policy arenas, future ecosystem service assessments should have clearly articulated objectives, seek to evaluate the consequences of alternative management actions, and facilitate closer engagement between scientists and stakeholders.},

However, there is little information about the proportion of CCF practised across the continent or about the knowledge gaps and other obstacles that limit its use. A survey of respondents in 33 European countries sought to address these issues. The results indicated that the silvicultural systems associated with CCF were single stem, group selection and irregular shelterwood. Rotational forest management (RFM) was more frequent than CCF in about 66 per cent of countries, whereas in 25 per cent the reverse was true. We estimated that between 22 and 30 per cent of European forests are managed through CCF, although good data are lacking. The main knowledge gaps were: uncertainties arising from climate change (e.g. appropriate species choice, carbon storage in CCF), using CCF to increase forest resilience, deployment of mechanized harvesting systems, lack of knowledge about CCF amongst professional foresters and better information on economic implications of this approach. Major obstacles included: little awareness of CCF amongst forest owners, limited competence in CCF within the forestry profession and a scarcity of skilled forest workers to implement this approach, high ungulate populations damaging natural regeneration, a sawmilling sector geared to processing medium-sized logs, subsidy regimes favouring practices associated with RFM and a lack of experience in transforming plantation forests to more diverse structures. Better information on the use of different silvicultural systems is essential to allow policymakers and other stakeholders to monitor progress in diversifying forests. Establishment of a continental network of long-term operational trials (e.g. expanding the existing Association Futaie Irr{\'e}guli{\`e}re network) would improve professional understanding of CCF, would demonstrate this approach to forest owners and other stakeholders and could provide a valuable platform for supporting research.},

  abstract = {The production of solar energy in cities is clearly a way to diminish our dependency to fossil fuels, and is a good way to mitigate global warming by lowering the emission of greenhouse gases. However, what are the impacts of solar panels locally? To evaluate their influence on urban weather, it is necessary to parameterize their effects within the surface schemes that are coupled to atmospheric models. The present paper presents a way to implement solar panels in the Town Energy Balance scheme, taking account of the energy production (for thermal and photovoltaic panels), the impact on the building below and feedback toward the urban micro-climate through radiative and convective fluxes. A scenario of large but realistic deployment of solar panels on the Paris metropolitan area is then simulated. It is shown that solar panels, by shading the roofs, slightly increases the need for domestic heating (3\%). In summer, however, the solar panels reduce the energy needed for air-conditioning (by 12\%) and also the Urban Heat Island (UHI): 0.2 K by day and up to 0.3 K at night. These impacts are larger than those found in previous works, because of the use of thermal panels (that are more efficient than photovoltaic panels) and the geographical position of Paris, which is relatively far from the sea. This means that it is not influenced by sea breezes, and hence that its UHI is stronger than for a coastal city of the same size. But this also means that local adaptation strategies aiming to decrease the UHI will have more potent effects.

In the average logging operation in the Douglas-Fir region of Oregon and Washington, about 27 per cent. of the net bd. ft. volume of the standing timber is being left to rot or burn in the woods. This amounts to 10, 000 bd. ft. of sawlog-sized material plus some 10 cords of small material per acre. From the rather meagre data available, it appears that relogging will be less costly per 1, 000 bd. ft. of logs than the original operation. This is due primarily to the fact that salvage stumpage is at present of but nominal value, and that the relogging operation takes advantage of the roads previously constructed. Log grades, however, are lower in the salvage operation. KEYWORDS: Costs, logging {\textbackslash} Logging {\textbackslash} Logging 'relogging' operations and equipment},

We discuss mitigation measures for Japan based on model projections. The integrated model included the forest model and the wood use model. Based on three scenarios (baseline, moderate increase, and rapid increase) of harvesting and wood use, the integrated model projected mitigation effects including carbon removal by forests and emission reduction through the wider use of wood, until 2050. Results indicate that forests will not become a source of net carbon emissions under the three scenarios considered. The baseline scenario is most effective for mitigating climate change, for most periods. However, the sum total of carbon removal in forests and carbon emission reductions by wood use under the rapid increase scenario exceeded the one of the moderate increase scenario after 2043. This was because of strong mitigation activities: promoting replanting, using new high-yield varieties, and wood use. The results also indicated that increases in emission reduction due to greater wood use compensated for 67.9 \% of the decrease of carbon removal in 2050, for the rapid increase scenario. The results show that carbon removal in forests is most important in the short term because of the relative youth of the planted forests in Japan, and that mitigation effects by material and energy substitution may become greater over the longer term.},

  abstract = {Coppicing was widespread across Europe for many centuries, but during the last 150 years, it has been largely abandoned. Most of the former coppices have been converted to high forest, especially in Central and northwestern Europe. Recently, there has been renewed interest in restoring coppices in some regions, primarily for biomass production and nature conservation. However, there is limited information on the sprouting ability of European tree species, which is the key prerequisite for successful coppice restoration. To address this gap, we evaluated the post-harvest stump sprouting of the three main species of Central European coppices-sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) and small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata Mill.)-in relation to the stump diameter and density of residual trees. Lime and hornbeam resprouted from stumps of all diameters, but sprouting ability declined with increasing stump diameter in sessile oak. Lime produced greater numbers of sprouts with greater diameters and heights than either oak or hornbeam. The number of sprouts per stump increased with stump diameter in all three species as did the height of lime and hornbeam sprouts, whereas there was no such effect on the height of oak sprouts. The sprouting of hornbeam and oak increased and decreased, respectively, with an increasing density of residual trees. In conclusion, our study shows that all of the studied species are able to resprout even at an old age and after a long period of neglect; however, there were important differences among the species. The results also indicate that the age of the parent trees at the time of cutting may significantly affect the tree species composition of a newly restored coppice. {\copyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Our goal was to find a minimum number of sprouts, i.e., the most easily obtainable, and sprout parameters that should be measured for accurate sprout biomass and carbon stock estimates. Using data for 5 common temperate woody species, we modelled carbon stock and sprout biomass as a function of an increasing number of sprouts in an interaction with different sprout parameters. The mean basal diameter of only two to five of the thickest sprouts and the basal diameter and DBH of the thickest sprouts per stump proved to be accurate estimators for the total sprout biomass of the individual resprouters and the populations of resprouters, respectively. Carbon stock estimates were strongly correlated with biomass estimates, but relative carbon content varied among species. Our study demonstrated that the size of the resprouters can be easily measured, and their biomass and carbon stock estimated; therefore, resprouters can be simply incorporated into studies of woody vegetation.},

  abstract = {Intensifying forest disturbance regimes are likely to impact heavily on future carbon (C) budgets of forest ecosystems. Our understanding of how forest disturbance affects the sources of soil CO2 efflux (Fs) is, however, poor. This may lead to uncertainties over future C sink estimates of forest ecosystems and associated feedbacks to the atmosphere. We investigated the impact of forest windthrow on the heterotrophic and autotrophic sources of Fs, underlying biotic and abiotic drivers (i.e. plant community composition, soil organic matter (SOM) properties and soil microclimate), and consequences for soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in~situ along a disturbance chronosequence in the European Alps. This chronosequence facilitated the study of temporal changes in the above parameters between the third and sixth years after windthrow. Along the chronosequence, structural equation~modelling revealed that soil temperature, soil moisture, SOM properties and plant community composition explained 90\% of the variation in Fs. While no direct interactions among plants and SOM properties could be determined, plants significantly affected soil microclimate. Windthrow had no obvious effect on Fs because reduced autotrophic soil respiration (Ra) was offset by a {$\sim$}60\% increase in heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh), principally due to increased soil temperatures. Ra after wind-throw was dominated by grasses and herbs rather than trees; however, a high abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi suggests an important indirect tree contribution to post-windthrow Ra. SOC stocks significantly declined over the post-windthrow period. Our results show that Rh was by far the dominant source of Fs after forest windthrow. As C losses from Rh and SOC stocks were in the same order of magnitude, this study demonstrates that post-windthrow declines in SOC stocks were mainly driven by a temperature-related increase in Rh. A lay summary is available for this article.},

  abstract = {Almost half of the total organic carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems is stored in forest soils. By altering rates of input or release of C from soils, forest management activities can influence soil C stocks in forests. In this review, we synthesize current evidence regarding the influences of 13 common forest management practices on forest soil C stocks. Afforestation of former croplands generally increases soil C stocks, whereas on former grasslands and peatlands, soil C stocks are unchanged or even reduced following afforestation. The conversion of primary forests to secondary forests generally reduces soil C stocks, particularly if the land is converted to an agricultural land-use prior to reforestation. Harvesting, particularly clear-cut harvesting, generally results in a reduction in soil C stocks, particularly in the forest floor and upper mineral soil. Removal of residues by harvesting whole-trees and stumps negatively affects soil C stocks. Soil disturbance from site preparation decreases soil C stocks, particularly in the organic top soil, however improved growth of tree seedlings may outweigh soil C losses over a rotation. Nitrogen (N) addition has an overall positive effect on soil C stocks across a wide range of forest ecosystems. Likewise, higher stocks and faster accumulation of soil C occur under tree species with N-fixing associates. Stocks and accumulation rates of soil C also differ under different tree species, with coniferous species accumulating more C in the forest floor and broadleaved species tending to store more C in the mineral soil. There is some evidence that increased tree species diversity could positively affect soil C stocks in temperate and subtropical forests, but tree species identity, particularly N-fixing species, seems to have a stronger impact on soil C stocks than tree species diversity. Management of stand density and thinning have small effects on forest soil C stocks. In forests with high populations of ungulate herbivores, reduction in herbivory levels can increase soil C stocks. Removal of plant biomass for fodder and fuel is related to a reduction in the soil C stocks. Fire management practices such as prescribed burning reduce soil C stocks, but less so than wildfires which are more intense. For each practice, we identify existing gaps in knowledge and suggest research to address the gaps.},

  abstract = {Severe droughts have been associated with regional-scale forest mortality worldwide. Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions. {\copyright} The Authors (2008).},

We simulated the physiology of a pi{\~n}on pine-juniper woodland (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma) that experienced mortality during a 5 yr precipitation-reduction experiment, allowing a framework with which to examine our knowledge of drought-induced tree mortality. We used six models designed for scales ranging from individual plants to a global level, all containing state-of-the-art representations of the internal hydraulic and carbohydrate dynamics of woody plants. Despite the large range of model structures, tuning, and parameterization employed, all simulations predicted hydraulic failure and carbon starvation processes co-occurring in dying trees of both species, with the time spent with severe hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, rather than absolute thresholds per se, being a better predictor of impending mortality. Model and empirical data suggest that limited carbon and water exchanges at stomatal, phloem, and below-ground interfaces were associated with mortality of both species. The model-data comparison suggests that the introduction of a mechanistic process into physiology-based models provides equal or improved predictive power over traditional process-model or empirical thresholds. Both biophysical and empirical modeling approaches are useful in understanding processes, particularly when the models fail, because they reveal mechanisms that are likely to underlie mortality. We suggest that for some ecosystems, integration of mechanistic pathogen models into current vegetation models, and evaluation against observations, could result in a breakthrough capability to simulate vegetation dynamics. {\copyright} 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

Forests store the majority of terrestrial carbon, thus their loss may have significant and sustained impacts on the global carbon cycle. We use a hydraulic corollary to Darcy's law, a core principle of vascular plant physiology, to predict characteristics of plants that will survive and die during drought under warmer future climates. Plants that are tall with isohydric stomatal regulation, low hydraulic conductance, and high leaf area are most likely to die from future drought stress. Thus, tall trees of old-growth forests are at the greatest risk of loss, which has ominous implications for terrestrial carbon storage. This application of Darcy's law indicates today's forests generally should be replaced by shorter and more xeric plants, owing to future warmer droughts and associated wildfires and pest attacks. The Darcy's corollary also provides a simple, robust framework for informing forest management interventions needed to promote the survival of current forests. Given the robustness of Darcy's law for predictions of vascular plant function, we conclude with high certainty that today's forests are going to be subject to continued increases in mortality rates that will result in substantial reorganization of their structure and carbon storage.},

  abstract = {Forest dynamics arise from the interplay of environmental drivers and disturbances with the demographic processes of recruitment, growth, and mortality, subsequently driving biomass and species composition. However, forest disturbances and subsequent recovery are shifting with global changes in climate and land use, altering these dynamics. Changes in environmental drivers, land use, and disturbance regimes are forcing forests toward younger, shorter stands. Rising carbon dioxide, acclimation, adaptation, and migration can influence these impacts. Recent developments in Earth system models support increasingly realistic simulations of vegetation dynamics. In parallel, emerging remote sensing datasets promise qualitatively new and more abundant data on the underlying processes and consequences for vegetation structure. When combined, these advances hold promise for improving the scientific understanding of changes in vegetation demographics and disturbances.},

  abstract = {Heterotrophic respiration (RH) is a major flux of CO2 from forest ecosystems and represents a large source of uncertainty in estimating net ecosystem productivity (NEP) using regional soil respiration (RS) models. RH from leaf litter (RHL) may contribute greatly to annual RH estimates, but its contribution may be misrepresented due to the logistical and technical challenges associated with chamber-based field measurements of RHL. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of sources of RH (mineral soil-derived heterotrophic respiration [RH] and leaf litter-derived heterotrophic respiration [RHL]) of a loblolly pine plantation (Pinus taeda L.) to varying soil and litter water content over the course of a dry down event. Additionally, we investigated whether fertilization influenced RHL and RHM to understand how forest nutrient management may impact forest soil carbon (C) dynamics. RHL was measured under dry conditions and at field capacity to evaluate water content controls on RHL, determine the duration of increased CO2 release following wetting, and evaluate the potential contribution to total RH. We also measured RHM inside collars that excluded plant roots and litter inputs, from field capacity until near-zero RHM rates were attained. We found that RHL was more sensitive to water content than RHM, and increased linearly with increasing litter water content (R2 = 0.89). The contribution of RHL to RH was greatest immediately following the wetting event, and decreased rapidly to near-zero rates between 3 and 10 days. RHM also had a strong relationship with soil water content (R2 = 0.62), but took between 200 and 233 days to attain near-zero RHM rates. Fertilization had no effect on RHM (p = 0.657), but significantly suppressed RHL rates after the wetting event (p {$<$} 0.009). These results demonstrate that there is great temporal variability in both CO2 released and the water content of differing sources of RH, and forest fertilization may largely impact forest floor C stocks. This variability may not be captured reliably using conventional weekly to monthly chamber-based field sampling efforts and could lead to over- or underestimation of RH. In the context of climate change, changes in the frequency and intensity of wetting and drying events will likely alter RHL and its contribution to RS. Separate consideration of RH sources and controls, along with increased field sampling frequency using chamber-based methodology under a broader range of specific environmental conditions, are likely needed to reduce variability in RH estimates and improve the accuracy of forest NEP predictions.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Because of the slow accumulation and long residence time of carbon in biomass and soils, the present state and future dynamics of temperate forests are influenced by management that took place centuries to millennia ago. Humans have exploited the forests of Europe for fuel, construction materials and fodder for the entire Holocene. In recent centuries, economic and demographic trends led to increases in both forest area and management intensity across much of Europe. In order to quantify the effects of these changes in forests and to provide a baseline for studies on future land-cover--climate interactions and biogeochemical cycling, we created a temporally and spatially resolved reconstruction of European forest management from 1600 to 2010. For the period 1600--1828, we took a supply--demand approach, in which supply was estimated on the basis of historical annual wood increment and land cover reconstructions. We made demand estimates by multiplying population with consumption factors for construction materials, household fuelwood, industrial food processing and brewing, metallurgy, and salt production. For the period 1829--2010, we used a supply-driven backcasting method based on national and regional statistics of forest age structure from the second half of the 20th century. Our reconstruction reproduces the most important changes in forest management between 1600 and 2010: (1) an increase of 593 000 km2 in conifers at the expense of deciduous forest (decreasing by 538 000 km2); (2) a 612 000 km2 decrease in unmanaged forest; (3) a 152 000 km2 decrease in coppice management; (4) a 818 000 km2 increase in high-stand management; and (5) the rise and fall of litter raking, which at its peak in 1853 resulted in the removal of 50 Tg dry litter per year.},

As climate change rose to prominence in the international environmental agenda, the neutrality hypothesis transformed from an ecological principle to a justification for using forest management in combating climate change. Despite persistent efforts, Odum's neutrality hypothesis has resisted both confirmation and refutation. In this opinion we show the limitations of past efforts to (in)validate Odum's neutrality hypothesis and propose new research directions for the community to permit a more general confirmation or refutation with current and near-future observations. We then demonstrate such an approach by using metabolic theory to formulate testable predictions for the total sink strength considering soil, litter, and biomass of mature or climax forests based on observations of tree biomass and individual density. In doing so, we show that ecological theory can create additional relevant, testable hypotheses to provide timely support to decision-makers seeking to address one of the world's most pressing environmental challenges.},

We used data from the literature to examine the stoichiometry of C, N, and P in forest foliage and litter on both global and biome levels. Additionally, we examined the scaling of nutrient investments with biomass and production both globally and within biomes to determine if and when these ratios respond to macroscale ecosystem properties (such as nutrient availability). We found that, while global forest C:N:P ratios in both foliage and litter were more variable than those of marine particulate matter, biome level (temperate broadleaf, temperate coniferous, and tropical) ratios were as constrained as marine ratios and statistically distinct from one another. While we were more interested in the relative constancy of the C:N:P ratios than their numerical value we did note, as have others, that the atomic ratios calculated for foliage (1212:28:1) and litter (3007:45:1) reflect the increased proportion of C-rich structural material characteristic of terrestrial vegetation. Carbon:nutrient ratios in litter were consistently higher than in comparable foliar data sets, suggesting that resorption of nutrients is a globally important mechanism, particularly for P. Litter C:N ratios were globally constant despite biome-level differences in foliar C:N; we speculate that this strong coupling may be caused by the significant contribution of immobile cell wall bound proteins to the total foliar N pool. Most ratios scaled isometrically across the range of biomass stocks and production in all biomes suggesting that ratios arise directly from physiological constraints and are insensitive to factors leading to shifts in biomass and production. There were, however, important exceptions to this pattern: nutrient investment in broadleaf forest litter and coniferous forest foliage increased disproportionately relative to C with increasing biomass and production suggesting a systematic influence of macroscopic factors on ratios.},

Responses to nutrient loading and methods of monitoring relevant indicators vary regionally, hindering interpretation of ecosystem state changes and preventing a straightforward pan-European assessment of eutrophication symptoms. Here we summarize responses to nutrient enrichment in Europe's seas, comparing existing time-series of selected pelagic (phytoplankton biomass and community composition, turbidity, N:P ratio) and benthic (macro flora and faunal communities, bottom oxygen condition) indicators based on their effectiveness in assessing eutrophication effects. Our results suggest that the Black Sea and Northern Adriatic appear to be recovering from eutrophication due to economic reorganization in the Black Sea catchment and nutrient abatement measures in the case of the Northern Adriatic. The Baltic is most strongly impacted by eutrophication due to its limited exchange and the prevalence of nutrient recycling. Eutrophication in the North Sea is primarily a coastal problem, but may be exacerbated by climatic changes. Indicator interpretation is strongly dependent on sea-specific knowledge of ecosystem characteristics, and no single indicator can be employed to adequately compare eutrophication state between European seas. Communicating eutrophication-related information to policy-makers could be facilitated through the use of consistent indicator selection and monitoring methodologies across European seas.

Based on an equalized daily energy uptake of 2000 kcal person-1 day-1, we compared these impacts with those of four dietary scenarios (D-A-CH, UGB, ovo-lacto vegetarian, vegan) and with average nutrition from 20 years ago, differentiating between effects caused by altering food losses, food wastage, and changed diets. In the year 2006 gender-related impacts were considered separately. With regard to the scenarios analyzed, the highest impact changes would be expected from the vegan and the ovo-lacto vegetarian diet. The impact potentials of the recommendations of UGB and D-A-CH rank third and fourth, but are still significant. Concerning gender, the average female diet is already closer to the recommendations than men's. In comparison to the years 1985-1989, all indicators (with the exception of blue water) show lower impacts, due mainly to changes in diet. In comparison to this, impact changes resulting from food wastage were lower and mainly contrarian, which could be explained by higher food wastage in 2006 compared to 1985-1989. {\copyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

These projections include all major anthropogenic greenhouse gases and are a result of a multi-year effort to produce new scenarios for climate change research. We combine a suite of atmospheric concentration observations and emissions estimates for greenhouse gases (GHGs) through the historical period (1750-2005) with harmonized emissions projected by four different Integrated Assessment Models for 2005-2100. As concentrations are somewhat dependent on the future climate itself (due to climate feedbacks in the carbon and other gas cycles), we emulate median response characteristics of models assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report using the reduced-complexity carbon cycle climate model MAGICC6. Projected 'best-estimate' global-mean surface temperature increases (using inter alia a climate sensitivity of 3{$^\circ$}C) range from 1.5{$^\circ$}C by 2100 for the lowest of the four RCPs, called both RCP3-PD and RCP2. 6, to 4.5{$^\circ$}C for the highest one, RCP8. 5, relative to pre-industrial levels. Beyond 2100, we present the ECPs that are simple extensions of the RCPs, based on the assumption of either smoothly stabilizing concentrations or constant emissions: For example, the lower RCP2. 6 pathway represents a strong mitigation scenario and is extended by assuming constant emissions after 2100 (including net negative CO2 emissions), leading to CO2 concentrations returning to 360 ppm by 2300. We also present the GHG concentrations for one supplementary extension, which illustrates the stringent emissions implications of attempting to go back to ECP4. 5 concentration levels by 2250 after emissions during the 21st century followed the higher RCP6 scenario. Corresponding radiative forcing values are presented for the RCP and ECPs. {\copyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Abstract. Recently, remotely sensed measurements of the near-infrared reflectance (NIRv) of vegetation, the fluorescence correction vegetation index (FCVI), and radiance (NIRvrad) of vegetation have emerged as indicators of vegetation structure and function with potential to enhance or improve upon commonly used indicators, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The applicability of these remotely sensed indices to tropical forests, key ecosystems for global carbon cycling and biodiversity, has been limited. In particular, fine-scale spatial and temporal heterogeneity of structure and physiology may contribute to variation in these indices and the properties that are presumed to be tracked by them, such as gross primary productivity (GPP) and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). In this study, fine-scale (approx.~15\,cm) tropical forest heterogeneity represented by NIRv, FCVI, and NIRvrad and by lidar-derived height is investigated and compared to NIRv and EVI using unoccupied aerial system (UAS)-based hyperspectral and lidar sensors. By exploiting near-infrared signals, NIRv, FCVI, and NIRvrad captured the greatest spatiotemporal variability, followed by the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and then the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Wavelet analyses showed the dominant spatial scale of variability of all indicators was driven by tree clusters and larger-than-tree-crown size gaps rather than individual tree crowns. NIRv, FCVI, NIRvrad, and EVI captured variability at smaller spatial scales ({$\sim$}\,50\,m) than NDVI ({$\sim$}\,90\,m) and the lidar-based surface model ({$\sim$}\,70\,m). We show that spatial and temporal patterns of NIRv and FCVI were virtually identical for a dense green canopy, confirming predictions in earlier studies. Furthermore, we show that NIRvrad, which does not require separate irradiance measurements, correlated more strongly with GPP and PAR than did other indicators. NIRv, FCVI, and NIRvrad, which are related to canopy structure and the radiation regime of vegetation canopies, are promising tools to improve understanding of tropical forest canopy structure and function.},

Tree-ring data were collected from a site east of Coburg, Bavaria which had shown pronounced stress-symptoms (early leaf coloration) during the record drought of 2018. Climate-growth relationships were used to establish the sensitivity of radial growth to multiple climatic variables. The impact of specific drought events on tree growth was quantified using tolerance indices. In addition, we employed a Principal Component Gradient Analysis (PCGA) and remote sensing data (MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) to delineate the species specific drought responses. Using these methods we were able to show a clear difference in drought susceptibility between beech and oak. Beech displayed a higher sensitivity to temperature and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and showed lower resistance and resilience to drought events than oak. In particular, beech was unable to fully recover from the 2003 drought, after which it expressed a stark growth decline, i.e. drought legacies, which was not observed for oak. The PCGA revealed a clear differentiation in the grouping of drought responses between beech and oak, supporting the findings of the climate-growth analysis and the tolerance indices. Correlations of NDVI and ring-width indices (RWI) indicated that under normal climatic conditions NDVI variability is linked to the start of the growing season. This is in contrast to drought years, such as 2003, where summer NDVI mirrored the drought response of beech and oak. These results reveal beech to have both a higher sensitivity to summer temperature and SPEI and a higher susceptibility to drought events. Although, in the past high plasticity and adaptability to drought have been attributed to both beech and oak, our study assigns beech a higher risk than oak to suffer from anticipated increases in drought frequency and intensity as a consequence of climate change.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Late-spring frost (LSF) is a critical factor influencing the functioning of temperate forest ecosystems. Frost damage in the form of canopy defoliation impedes the ability of trees to effectively photosynthesize, thereby reducing tree productivity. In recent decades, LSF frequency has increased across Europe, likely intensified by the effects of climate change. With increasing warming, many deciduous tree species have shifted towards earlier budburst and leaf development. The earlier start of the growing season not only facilitates forest productivity but also lengthens the period during which trees are most susceptible to LSF. Moreover, recent forest transformation efforts in Europe intended to increase forest resilience to climate change have focused on increasing the share of deciduous species in forests. To assess the ability of forests to remain productive under climate change, dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) have proven to be useful tools. Currently, however, most state-of-the-art DVMs do not model processes related to LSF and the associated impacts. Here, we present a novel LSF module for integration with the dynamic vegetation model Lund--Potsdam--Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS). This new model implementation, termed LPJ-GUESS-FROST, provides the ability to directly attribute simulated impacts on forest productivity dynamics to LSF. We use the example of European beech, one of the dominant deciduous species in central Europe, to demonstrate the functioning of our novel LSF module. Using a network of tree-ring observations from past frost events, we show that LPJ-GUESS-FROST can reproduce productivity reductions caused by LSF. Further, to exemplify the effects of including LSF dynamics in DVMs, we run LPJ-GUESS-FROST for a study region in southern Germany for which high-resolution climate observations are available. Here, we show that modeled LSF plays a substantial role in regulating regional net primary production (NPP) and biomass dynamics, emphasizing the need for LSF to be more widely accounted for in DVMs.},

We encourage flexible approaches that promote reversible and incremental steps, and that favor ongoing learning and capacity to modify direction as situations change. We suggest that no single solution fits all future challenges, especially in the context of changing climates, and that the best strategy is to mix different approaches for different situations. Resources managers will be challenged to integrate adaptation strategies (actions that help ecosystems accommodate changes adaptively) and mitigation strategies (actions that enable ecosystems to reduce anthropogenic influences on global climate) into overall plans. Adaptive strategies include resistance options (forestall impacts and protect highly valued resources), resilience options (improve the capacity of ecosystems to return to desired conditions after disturbance), and response options (facilitate transition of ecosystems from current to new conditions). Mitigation strategies include options to sequester carbon and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions. Priority-setting approaches (e.g., triage), appropriate for rapidly changing conditions and for situations where needs are greater than available capacity to respond, will become increasingly important in the future. {\copyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {With the Paris Agreement's ambition of limiting climate change to well below 2 {$^\circ$}C, negative emission technologies (NETs) have moved into the limelight of discussions in climate science and policy. Despite several assessments, the current knowledge on NETs is still diffuse and incomplete, but also growing fast. Here, we synthesize a comprehensive body of NETs literature, using scientometric tools and performing an in-depth assessment of the quantitative and qualitative evidence therein. We clarify the role of NETs in climate change mitigation scenarios, their ethical implications, as well as the challenges involved in bringing the various NETs to the market and scaling them up in time. There are six major findings arising from our assessment: first, keeping warming below 1.5 {$^\circ$}C requires the large-scale deployment of NETs, but this dependency can still be kept to a minimum for the 2 {$^\circ$}C warming limit. Second, accounting for economic and biophysical limits, we identify relevant potentials for all NETs except ocean fertilization. Third, any single NET is unlikely to sustainably achieve the large NETs deployment observed in many 1.5 {$^\circ$}C and 2 {$^\circ$}C mitigation scenarios. Yet, portfolios of multiple NETs, each deployed at modest scales, could be invaluable for reaching the climate goals. Fourth, a substantial gap exists between the upscaling and rapid diffusion of NETs implied in scenarios and progress in actual innovation and deployment. If NETs are required at the scales currently discussed, the resulting urgency of implementation is currently neither reflected in science nor policy. Fifth, NETs face severe barriers to implementation and are only weakly incentivized so far. Finally, we identify distinct ethical discourses relevant for NETs, but highlight the need to root them firmly in the available evidence in order to render such discussions relevant in practice.},

  abstract = {A thinning experiment has been conducted since 1971 on two 22-year-old stands of Norway spruce in the Belgian Ardenne. The stands have strongly contrasting water availability. In 1995, tree ring-width series were measured from increment cores sampled in control plots along with three different thinning intensity treatments. Relative growth indices were calculated by standardisation which involved fitting a curve to the measured series, and then dividing each measured value by the corresponding curve value. Based on reconstruction of the monthly values of soil water content (SWC), climatic response functions were calibrated on growth indices from the control treatment. In the humid stand, radial growth is mostly under lagged climatic control. In the dry stand, radial growth is instantaneously related to water supply during the early part of the vegetation period. The response functions were used to remove the climatic signal present in the growth indices calculated for the thinned treatments. This procedure does not allow the entire climatic signal in the growth indices of the dry stand to be removed. We show that reducing the stand density alters the classical relationship between climate and radial growth. At least in the short term, thinning improves the resistance of tree radial growth to drought stresses. This effect is more obvious on the humid stand than on the dry stand. We show also that observations and climate-based simulation of growth indices in the heavily thinned treatments have an inverse cycling behaviour. In the humid stand, trees from the heavily thinned plots showed growth reduction during the eighties, while simulation growth indices from the climatic response function were quite stable. While tree growth from the lightly thinned treatment remains coupled to climate because of high inter-tree competition for water supply, tree growth from the heavily thinned plots could be sensitive to other limiting factors that may involve atmospheric pollution. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

There is therefore much interest in comparing worked coppice, neglected coppice and high forest systems as options for woodland management, particularly where several objectives (all or any of nature conservation, wood production, recreation, landscape or the production of game) must be satisfied, within a financial constraint.},

This paper provides an integrative overview of the nature, contributing factors and impacts of wind-caused disturbance in forests, including its effects on trees, stands, landscapes and soils. Windthrow is examined through the integrating concepts of: the capacity of trees for acclimative growth, the limitation of acclimative growth under inter-tree competition, the recurrent nature of severe weather, how terrain and soil conditions affect local stand vulnerability and the effect of recurrent windthrow on stand dynamics and soils. Windthrow management should take place within a framework of general risk management, with evaluation of the likelihood, severity and potential impacts of wind damage considered - with reference to the broad and specific aims of management. There is much to be gained from interdisciplinary communication about the nature and consequences of recurrent wind damage. There are opportunities for climatologists, engineers, ecologists, geomorphologists and others to develop integrative process models at the tree, stand and landscape scales that will improve our collective understanding, and inform management decision-making. {\copyright} Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2012.

Remote-sensing estimates to quantify carbon losses from global forests 2--5 are characterized by considerable uncertainty and we lack a comprehensive ground-sourced evaluation to benchmark these estimates. Here we combine several ground-sourced 6 and satellite-derived approaches 2,7,8 to evaluate the scale of the global forest carbon potential outside agricultural and urban lands. Despite regional variation, the predictions demonstrated remarkable consistency at a global scale, with only a 12\% difference between the ground-sourced and satellite-derived estimates. At present, global forest carbon storage is markedly under the natural potential, with a total deficit of 226 Gt (model range = 151--363 Gt) in areas with low human footprint. Most (61\%, 139 Gt C) of this potential is in areas with existing forests, in which ecosystem protection can allow forests to recover to maturity. The remaining 39\% (87 Gt C) of potential lies in regions in which forests have been removed or fragmented. Although forests cannot be a substitute for emissions reductions, our results support the idea 2,3,9 that the conservation, restoration and sustainable management of diverse forests offer valuable contributions to meeting global climate and biodiversity targets.},

Aside from their sea-level location, they are both characterized by large populations, valuable infrastructure and real estate, and economic dependence on tourism, as well as the availability of advanced scientific data and technological expertize. Yet their responses have been quite different. We examine the biophysical environments of the two cities, as well as their socio-economic features, administrative arrangements vulnerabilities, and responses to sea level rise and flooding. Our study uses a qualitative approach to illustrate how adaptation policies have emerged in these two coastal cities. Based on this information, we critically compare the different adaptive responses of Venice and Miami and suggest what each city may learn from the other, as well as offer lessons for other vulnerable coastal cities. In the two cases presented here it would seem that adaptation to SLR has not yet led to a reformulation of the problem or a structural transformation of the relevant institutions. Decision-makers must address the complex issue of rising seas with a combination of scientific knowledge, socio-economic expertize, and good governance. In this regard, the ``hi-tech'' approach of Venice has generated problems of its own (as did the flood control projects in South Florida over half a century ago), while the increasing public mobilization in Miami appears more promising. The importance of continued long-term adaptation measures is essential in both cities.},

  abstract = {Key message: The concept of expected losses is an appropriate measure for integrating risk in the determination of the optimal rotation period and choice of tree species. Context: Natural threats are challenging forest management decisions. Essential decisions about the optimal length of a harvest period are often taken without considering risks. Aims: Here, a practical and easy to apply way to integrate risk in these decisions is shown. Furthermore, it is seen how the rotation period changes according to the risk-type and risk-level. Methods: The marginal principle of Pre{\ss}ler's indicator rate is developed further by including the concept of expected losses, leading to an optimal harvest age under risk. The application of the new formula is shown by a simulation, which also visualises the influence on the optimal rotation age. Results: Whether risk influences the optimal harvest age compared to a risk free solution, depends on the relationship between expected losses in terms of land rent of the succeeding stand and expected losses in terms of value growth of the existing stand. If they are equal, the rotation age stays. If the expected loss on value growth is bigger than on land rent, the rotation period will be shorter, while it will be longer if the relation is inverse. Conclusion: The concept of expected losses can be applied to practically determine the optimal rotation period under risk.},

  abstract = {Production of marketed commodities and protection of biodiversity in natural systems often conflict and thus the continuously expanding human needs for more goods and benefits from global ecosystems urgently calls for strategies to resolve this conflict. In this paper, we addressed what is the potential of a forest landscape to simultaneously produce habitats for species and economic returns, and how the conflict between habitat availability and timber production varies among taxa. Secondly, we aimed at revealing an optimal combination of management regimes that maximizes habitat availability for given levels of economic returns. We used multi-objective optimization tools to analyze data from a boreal forest landscape consisting of about 30,000 forest stands simulated 50 years into future. We included seven alternative management regimes, spanning from the recommended intensive forest management regime to complete set-aside of stands (protection), and ten different taxa representing a wide variety of habitat associations and social values. Our results demonstrate it is possible to achieve large improvements in habitat availability with little loss in economic returns. In general, providing dead-wood associated species with more habitats tended to be more expensive than providing requirements for other species. No management regime alone maximized habitat availability for the species, and systematic use of any single management regime resulted in considerable reductions in economic returns. Compared with an optimal combination of management regimes, a consistent application of the recommended management regime would result in 5\% reduction in economic returns and up to 270\% reduction in habitat availability. Thus, for all taxa a combination of management regimes was required to achieve the optimum. Refraining from silvicultural thinnings on a proportion of stands should be considered as a cost-effective management in commercial forests to reconcile the conflict between economic returns and habitat required by species associated with dead-wood. In general, a viable strategy to maintain biodiversity in production landscapes would be to diversify management regimes. Our results emphasize the importance of careful landscape level forest management planning because optimal combinations of management regimes were taxon-specific. For cost-efficiency, the results call for balanced and correctly targeted strategies among habitat types. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Given the substantial contributions of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services to society, forest sciences have a large potential to contribute to the integrity and sustainability of our future. This is especially true when the roles of biodiversity for sustaining ecosystem services are considered. The rapid expansion of sustainable forest management (SFM) has resulted in the adoption of various forest management frameworks intended to safeguard biodiversity. Concurrently, the importance of forest ecosystem services has been increasingly recognized. Although some initiatives aimed at conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services are emerging, knowledge gaps still exist about their relationships and potential trade-offs in forests. Given recent advancements, increasing opportunities and some lags in forest ecology, further research on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services will play substantial roles in the development of SFM practices. Here, we identified key issues including (i) relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function as a foundation of ecological integrity, (ii) resilience thinking to better prepare for and adapt to environmental changes, (iii) social--ecological perspectives that facilitate real-world conservation and management and (iv) theory-driven restoration that bridges science and practice. Thus, we illustrate priorities and future possibilities in applied ecology studies in forests, which will help society and ecosystems to build capacity and resilience to face uncertainty in the changing environment. Synthesis and applications. Under substantial human influences, forests are highly likely to be largely altered, potentially leading to the emergence of novel ecosystems or alternative stable states. Management thus needs more flexible, novel measures to address the significant uncertainty this generates. Resilience-based approaches are important to respond adaptively to future changes and cope with surprises, potentially providing multiple options. Although challenges exist, theory should play an important role in managing, conserving and restoring forest ecosystems. The issues discussed here should receive further attention in the context of the multiple goals of sustainable forest management.},

In addition, use of wood density, volume and mass loss to quantitatively describe the degree of decay was tested. The mass loss during decay could be described by a simple exponential function. Under the presented climatic conditions, beech coarse woody debris (CWD) with a diameter {$>$}10 cm decays completely in about 35 years. In the first 8 years of decay the mass loss is determined by the decrease in wood density, and subsequently by the loss in volume. Estimation of wood density allows the first three of the four classes of decay to be distinguished, while trees in the last two decay classes could be distinguished using wood volume. Beech fine woody debris with a diameter between 1 and 10 cm decays within about 18 years. The litter fraction of {$<$}1 cm is part of the humus layer after 4 years. If there are goals for the amounts, types and dimensions of woody debris to be provided for conservation of biological biodiversity and other ecological functions in managed beech forests, this study offer indications for how long existing woody debris can meet its functions and how frequent new input of CWD is required. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

Our review of dead-wood threshold data from European forests revealed 36 critical values with ranges of 10-80 m3 ha-1 for boreal and lowland forests and 10-150 m3 ha-1 for mixed-montane forests, with peak values at 20-30 m3 ha-1 for boreal coniferous forests, 30-40 m3 ha-1 for mixed-montane forests, and 30-50 m3 ha-1 for lowland oak-beech forests. We then expand the focus of dead-wood threshold analyses to community composition. We exemplify the two major statistical methods applied in ecological threshold analysis to stimulate forest researchers to analyze more of their own data with a focus on thresholds. Finally, we discuss further directions of dead-wood threshold analysis. We anticipate that further investigations of threshold values will provide a more comprehensive picture of critical ranges for dead wood, which is urgently needed for an ecological and sustainable forestry. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

In this sense, remotely sensed vegetation parameters, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), are widely used in the monitoring and forecasting of vegetation patterns in regions at risk of desertification. Therefore, the objective of this study was to model NDVI time series at six desertification hotspots in the Brazilian semi-arid region and to verify the applicability of such models in forecasting vegetation dynamics. We used NDVI data obtained from the MOD13A2 product of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor, comprising 16-day composites time series of mean NDVI and NDVI variance for each hotspot during the 2000--2018 period. We also used rainfall measured by weather stations as an explanatory variable in some of the tested models. Firstly, we compared Holt-Winters with Box-Jenkins and Box-Jenkins-Tiao (BJT) models. In all hotspots the Box-Jenkins and BJT models performed slightly better than Holt-Winters models. Overall, model performance did not improve with the inclusion of rainfall as an exogenous explanatory variable. Mean NDVI series were modelled with a correlation of up to 0.94 and a minimum mean absolute percentage error of 5.1\%. NDVI variance models performed slightly worse, with a correlation of up to 0.82 and a minimum mean absolute percentage error of 22.0\%. After the selection of the best models, we combined mean NDVI and NDVI variance models in order to forecast mean-variance plots that represent vegetation state dynamics. The combined models performed better in representing dry and degraded vegetation states if compared to robust and heterogeneous vegetation during wet periods. The forecasts for one seasonal period ahead were satisfactory, indicating that such models could be used as tools for the monitoring of short-term vegetation states.},

  abstract = {Background: Replacing non-renewable materials and energy with wood offers a potential strategy to mitigate climate change if the net emissions of ecosystem and technosystem are reduced in a considered time period. Displacement factors (DFs) describe an emission reduction for a wood-based product or fuel which is used in place of a non-wood alternative. The aims of this review were to map and assess DFs from scientific literature and to provide findings on how to harmonise practices behind them and to support coherent application. Results: Most of the reviewed DFs were positive, implying decreasing fossil GHG emissions in the technosystem. The vast majority of the reviewed DFs describe avoided fossil emissions either both in processing and use of wood or only in the latter when wood processing emissions were considered separately. Some of the reviewed DFs included emissions avoided in post-use of harvested wood products (HWPs). Changes in forest and product carbon stocks were not included in DFs except in a few single cases. However, in most of the reviewed studies they were considered separately in a consistent way along with DFs. DFs for wood energy, construction and material substitution were widely available, whereas DFs for packaging products, chemicals and textiles were scarce. More than half of DFs were calculated by the authors of the reviewed articles while the rest of them were adopted from other articles. Conclusions: Most of the reviewed DFs describe the avoided fossil GHG emissions. These DFs may provide insights on the wood-based products with a potential to replace emissions intensive alternatives but they do not reveal the actual climate change mitigation effects of wood use. The way DFs should be applied and interpreted depends on what has been included in them. If the aim of DFs is to describe the overall climate effects of wood use, DFs should include all the relevant GHG flows, including changes in forest and HWP carbon stock and post-use of HWPs, however, based on this literature review this is not a common practice. DFs including only fossil emissions should be applied together with a coherent assessment of changes in forest and HWP carbon stocks, as was the case in most of the reviewed studies. To increase robustness and transparency and to decrease misuse, we recommend that system boundaries and other assumptions behind DFs should be clearly documented.},

  abstract = {In Europe, forest policy discussions are moving towards a European Union-wide strategy. This will further intensify the relations between European countries in the field of forests and forest management. European-wide forest planning and decision-making require that policy makers have insight into the long-term development of European forests under alternative regimes. The European Forest Information Scenario Model (EFISCEN) was used to make projections of the development of the European forests under four scenarios: (1) business as usual; (2) EFISCEN European timber trend studies (ETTS); (3) maximum sustainable production; and (4) multifunctional management. The simulations were carried out for 30 countries individually, i.e. harmonized scenarios were run, but the special circumstances and demands that play a role in each country were taken into account. The simulations covered 139.2 million ha increasing to 143 million ha in 2050. The initial year varied per country, but was mostly in the region of 1990. The average age of European forests was 57 years in 1990 with a mean growing stock of 142 m3 ha-1. The results showed that the future European total fellings may vary between a stable amount of 400 million m3 year-1 in the 'business as usual' scenario to 647 million m3 year-1 in the 'maximum sustainable production' scenario. The other two scenarios incorporated a 9\% gradual increase in fellings over the first 30 years of the simulation period (i.e. 0.3\% year-1). The average growing stock will rise to approximately 250 m3 ha-1 in 2050, with the exception being the 'maximum sustainable production' scenario, in which the growing remains at approximately 137 m3 ha-1. The average net annual increment remains at approximately 5 m3 ha-1 year-1 throughout the simulation period, almost irrespective of the scenario. In the multifunctional scenario, special attention was paid to nature values by increasing the area of strict reserves from 4 million ha in 1990 to 12.3 million ha in 2050 (8.6\% of the total forest area). The assumed increase in fellings of 0.3\% year-1 appeared possible in combination with this area of reserves. The simulations showed that growing stock development and increment development differed very much for each country separately per scenario. Therefore, the results show a strong need for maintaining the national diversity that constitutes European forestry within harmonized European-wide forest management strategies. In this article, we address what the consequences of each scenario are for wood production, biodiversity, and environmental functions of the forest. The results provide policy makers with a challenge on whether to intervene in the ongoing trend of build-up of growing stock and whether to choose for biodiversity, for increased use of domestically produced wood products, or a combination of these, but spatially separated. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The results of these projections provide insight in the state of the European forests and indicate that under the 'new management trends' supply can still increase to 729 million m3 by 2060 in Europe, whereby almost throughout Europe we allow harvest to be higher than increment for some time. Without linking countries dynamically through international trade, we identify regions where harvesting pressure is highest. Under the new management trends scenario, the harvested volume is reduced with 82 million m3/year (compared to 'projection of historical management') because of stricter management constraints. However, the management regimes as parameterised here allow harvesting pressure to remain highest in Central Europe and some Scandinavian countries, notably Finland and Norway. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

The Climate and Energy Framework aims at a total emission reduction of 40\% by 2030 for all sectors together as part of the Paris Agreement. The LULUCF proposal regulates a "no debit" target for LULUCF (Forests and Agricultural soils), and regulates the accounting of any additional mitigation potential that might be expected of it. We find that the forest share of the LULUCF sector can achieve much more than what is in the regulation now. We elaborate a strategy for unlocking European Union (EU) forests and forest sector potential based on the concept of "climate smart forestry" (CSF). We find that to-date, European policy has not firmly integrated forest potential into the EU climate policy framework. Nor have climate objectives been firmly integrated into those of the forest and forest sector at either the EU or national level. Yet a wide range of measures can be applied to provide positive incentives for more firmly integrating these climate objectives into the forest and forest sector framework. With the right set of incentives in place at EU and Member States levels, we find the current literature supports the view that the EU has the potential to achieve an additional combined mitigation impact through CSF of 441 Mt CO2/year by 2050. In addition, CSF, through reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting and building forest resilience, and sustainably increasing forest productivity and incomes, tackles multiple policy goals.},

  abstract = {F orests and the forest sector play a significant role in climate change mitigation through the cap- ture of CO2 in forests and wood products, as well as through material and energy substitution. An earlier EFI study (Nabuurs et al. 2015) found that forests and the forest sector's role could be significantly strength- ened through Climate-Smart Forestry (CSF). This is a targeted approach or strategy to increase the climate benefits from forests and the forest sector, in a way that creates synergies with other needs related to for- ests. The approach builds on three pillars: {$\bullet$} reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emis- sions to mitigate climate change {$\bullet$} adapting forest management to build resilient for- ests {$\bullet$} active forest management aiming to sustainably increase productivity and provide all benefits that forests can provide. However, CSF measures can be regionally very differ- ent due to significantly varying regional circumstanc- es across Europe. This follow-up study to Nabuurs et al. (2015) demonstrates how a variety of concrete CSF measures would impact CO2 removals through forestry activities in three different regions in Europe. Simulation models were applied to conduct sce- nario analysis for Spain, the Czech Republic and the Republic of Ireland. Each region has different charac- teristics in their forests and forest sectors: {$\bullet$} Spain, in this study represented by the Mediterranean region of Catalonia, has very dry circumstances, a modest management intensity of forests and is confronted with wildfires. {$\bullet$} Forests in the Czech Republic have a high biomass stocking, which may be difficult to maintain over a longer period due to potential disturbance risks, such as droughts, storms, pests and pathogens. {$\bullet$} Forests in the Republic of Ireland are generally young, fast-growing forests with up to now a low harvesting rate, and a large share of forests are growing on drained peatlands. Scenario projections for parts of Spain (1.6 mil- lion ha), the Czech Republic (2.7 million ha) and Republic of Ireland (0.8 million ha) provided insights in the carbon balance of the forest ecosystems, and harvested wood products material and energy sub- stitution effects.},

  abstract = {The role of unmanaged forests is discussed controversially in the context of climate change. One of the key questions is, whether they can contribute to the mitigation of climate change as a carbon sink and storage. However, carbon dynamics of forests after the cessation of management are not well understood. We analyzed a set of 64 forest sites, covering wide gradients of time since abandonment (0--68 years) and stand age (65--261 years) in even-aged, unmanaged beech forests. Five sites that were unmanaged for {$>$}100 years complemented the main dataset. We compiled site-specific carbon balances, distinguishing six carbon-compartments: Carbon in aboveground living and dead biomass, carbon in belowground living and dead biomass, and carbon in the organic layer and the mineral topsoil (0--30 cm). We found positive effects of increasing TSA on the carbon stock in living biomass and aboveground dead biomass for up to 50 years after management ceased. The average increase of the total carbon stock over 50 years of TSA was {$\approx$} 80 Mg C ha--1. The effect of stand age on aboveground living biomass showed a convex relation. Aboveground dead biomass increased logistically with TSA, while belowground dead biomass decreased. On average, the five sites unmanaged for {$>$}100 years held lower total carbon stocks compared to the observed biomass peak around 50 years of TSA. However, they contained considerably higher amounts of deadwood. Carbon in the mineral soil did neither change with TSA nor with stand age and was driven by pH. Carbon stocks in newly unmanaged forests increased almost linearly for approximately 50 years after cessation of management. Subsequently, a stabilization or medium-term decrease in carbon stock was observed, likely due to the initiating transition from even-aged to multi-aged structures. We conclude that, besides their value for biodiversity and ecosystem functions, the potential of naturally developing forests as a medium-term carbon sink and long-term stable carbon storage should be considered as a valuable contribution to Climate-Smart Forestry.},

A comprehensive knowledge of the major factors controlling the rate of carbonation, and their effects on the properties of the materials subjected to it, is necessary for using this technology for CO 2 sequestration. Most of the studies related to the carbonation are limited to its effects on corrosion of reinforced steel, cover depth design, and service life prediction of reinforced concrete structures. The possibility of using carbonation process as a direct means for carbon dioxide sequestration is yet to be realized. This paper discusses the application of carbonation technique in cement-based products for CO 2 sequestration for reducing its concentration in the Earth's atmosphere.

The aim of this study was thus to carry out a long-term field trial based on the poplar short-rotation coppice (SRC), in order to compare dry matter, energy-use efficiency and the net energy yield obtainable from this crop in relation to different harvest frequencies (1-, 2- and 3-year cutting cycles). The results showed that poplar SRC performed very well under temperate climates as it can survive up to 12 years, providing a considerable annual biomass yield (9.9, 13.8, 16.4 t ha-1 yr-1 for annual T1, biannual T2 and triennial T3 cutting cycles, respectively). The system tested in southern Europe showed a positive energy balance characterized by a high energy efficiency. We found that the choice of harvest interval had huge consequences in terms of energy yields. In fact, the energy efficiency improved from T1 to T2 and T3, while the net energy yield increased from 172 to 299 GJ ha-1 yr-1. This study suggests that, with 3-year harvest cycles, poplar SRC can contribute to agronomic and environmental sustainability not only in terms of its high yield and energy efficiency but also in terms of its positive influence on limiting soil tillage and on the environment, given its low pesticide and nutrient requirements.},

However, the amount of CO2 released in winter is not known and has not been well represented by ecosystem models or empirically based estimates5,6. Here we synthesize regional in situ observations of CO2 flux from Arctic and boreal soils to assess current and future winter carbon losses from the northern permafrost domain. We estimate a contemporary loss of 1,662 TgC per year from the permafrost region during the winter season (October--April). This loss is greater than the average growing season carbon uptake for this region estimated from process models (-1,032 TgC per year). Extending model predictions to warmer conditions up to 2100 indicates that winter CO2 emissions will increase 17\% under a moderate mitigation scenario---Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5---and 41\% under business-as-usual emissions scenario---Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Our results provide a baseline for winter CO2 emissions from northern terrestrial regions and indicate that enhanced soil CO2 loss due to winter warming may offset growing season carbon uptake under future climatic conditions.},

Since 70\% of global forests are managed and forests impact the global carbon cycle and the energy exchange with the overlying atmosphere, forest management has the potential to mitigate climate change. Yet, none of the land surface models used in Earth system models, and therefore none of today's predictions of future climate, account for the interactions between climate and forest management. We addressed this gap in modelling capability by developing and parametrizing a version of the land surface model ORCHIDEE to simulate the biogeochemical and biophysical effects of forest management. The most significant changes between the new branch called ORCHIDEE-CAN (SVN r2290) and the trunk version of ORCHIDEE (SVN r2243) are the allometric-based allocation of carbon to leaf, root, wood, fruit and reserve pools; the transmittance, absorbance and reflectance of radiation within the canopy; and the vertical discretisation of the energy budget calculations. In addition, conceptual changes towards a{\textasciitilde}better process representation occurred for the interaction of radiation with snow, the hydraulic architecture of plants, the representation of forest management and a{\textasciitilde}numerical solution for the photosynthesis formalism of Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry. For consistency reasons, these changes were extensively linked throughout the code. Parametrization was revisited after introducing twelve new parameter sets that represent specific tree species or genera rather than a group of unrelated species, as is the case in widely used plant functional types. Performance of the new model was compared against the trunk and validated against independent spatially explicit data for basal area, tree height, canopy strucure, GPP, albedo and evapotranspiration over Europe. For all tested variables ORCHIDEE-CAN outperformed the trunk regarding its ability to reproduce large-scale spatial patterns as well as their inter-annual variability over Europe. Depending on the data stream, ORCHIDEE-CAN had a 67 to 92\% chance to reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of the validation data.},

  abstract = {The most sustainable and best quality fresh water sources in the world originate in forest ecosystems. The biological, chemical, and physical characteristics of forest soils are particularly well suited to delivering high quality water to streams, moderating stream hydrology, and providing diverse aquatic habitat. Forest soils feature litter layers and high organic contents, both of which contribute to an abundant and diverse micro- and macro-fauna. Root systems under forests are extensive and relatively deep compared to agricultural lands and grasslands. Together, these biological conditions create soils with high macroporosity, low bulk density, and highly saturated hydraulic conductivities and infiltration rates. Consequently, surface runoff is rare in forest environments, and most rainfall moves to streams by subsurface flow pathways where nutrient uptake, cycling, and contaminant sorption processes are rapid. Because of the dominance of subsurface flow processes, peak flows are moderated and baseflows are prolonged. Conversion of forests to row crops, pastures, or lawns almost always results in deterioration of water quality. In North America, the majority of municipalities ultimately rely on forested watersheds to provide adequate quantities of high quality water for human use. This is particularly true in the western and eastern parts of the continent where human populations are large or growing rapidly. Forest soils provide the perfect conditions for creating high quality water supplies. This paper provides a historical perspective of the linkage between forest soils and water quantity and quality over the past century, and it also makes predictions about research directions in the area of forest soil and water quality linkages.},

Such slow rates of recovery underscore the need to replace outdated models of forest succession with models that emphasize the importance of fire, herbivory, and long periods of time to grassland biodiversity.

For the future, a strong increase in grain demand is expected, which may be fulfilled by further agricultural intensification rather than expansion of agricultural area. Little is known, however, about the global potential for intensification and its constraints. In the presented study, we analyze to what extent the available spatially explicit global biophysical and land management-related data are able to explain the yield gap of global grain production. We combined an econometric approach with spatial analysis to explore the maximum attainable yield, yield gap, and efficiencies of wheat, maize, and rice production. Results show that the actual grain yield in some regions is already approximating its maximum possible yields while other regions show large yield gaps and therefore tentative larger potential for intensification. Differences in grain production efficiencies are significantly correlated with irrigation, accessibility, market influence, agricultural labor, and slope. Results of regional analysis show, however, that the individual contribution of these factors to explaining production efficiencies strongly varies between world-regions. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The global MODIS NPP dataset using the MOD17 algorithm provides valuable information for monitoring NPP at 1-km resolution. Since coarse-resolution global climate data are used, the global dataset may contain uncertainties for Europe. We used a 1-km daily gridded European climate data set with the MOD17 algorithm to create the regional NPP dataset MODIS EURO. For evaluation of this new dataset, we compare MODIS EURO with terrestrial driven NPP from analyzing and harmonizing forest inventory data (NFI) from 196,434 plots in 12 European countries as well as the global MODIS NPP dataset for the years 2000 to 2012. Comparing these three NPP datasets, we found that the global MODIS NPP dataset differs from NFI NPP by 26\%, while MODIS EURO only differs by 7\%. MODIS EURO also agrees with NFI NPP across scales (from continental, regional to country) and gradients (elevation, location, tree age, dominant species, etc.). The agreement is particularly good for elevation, dominant species or tree height. This suggests that using improved climate data allows the MOD17 algorithm to provide realistic NPP estimates for Europe. Local discrepancies between MODIS EURO and NFI NPP can be related to differences in stand density due to forest management and the national carbon estimation methods. With this study, we provide a consistent, temporally continuous and spatially explicit productivity dataset for the years 2000 to 2012 on a 1-km resolution, which can be used to assess climate change impacts on ecosystems or the potential biomass supply of the European forests for an increasing bio-based economy.

Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reduce within-sample species richness by an average of 76.5\%, total abundance by 39.5\% and rarefaction-based richness by 40.3\%. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6\%), total abundance (10.7\%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1\%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4\% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strong mitigation can deliver much more positive biodiversity changes (up to a 1.9\% average increase) that are less strongly related to countries' socioeconomic status.},

  abstract = {Scientific integrity and consensus rely on the peer review process, a defining feature of scientific discourse that subjects the literature forming the foundation of credible knowledge in a scientific field to rigorous scrutiny. However, there is surprisingly little training in graduate school on how to develop this essential skill [Zimmerman et al., 2011] or discussion of best practices to ensure that reviewers at all levels efficiently provide the most useful review. Even more challenging for the novice peer reviewer is that journals also vary widely in their review guidelines. Nonetheless, the goals of peer review are crystal clear: to ensure the accuracy and improve the quality of published literature through constructive criticism. To make the peer review process as efficient and productive as possible, you may want to consider a few useful approaches to tackling major steps throughout your review, from contemplating a review request and reading and assessing the manuscript to writing the review and interacting with the journal's editors (see Figure 1). These tips are particularly relevant for graduate students or other first-time reviewers, but they may also be useful to experienced reviewers and to journal editors seeking to enhance their publication's processes.},

  abstract = {Background: Protected areas (PAs) are aimed to hold the environmental conditions that facilitate species and ecosystems to persist. PAs can become climatically unsuitable and unable to sustain their current number of species under climate change. The Natura 2000 (N2K) is the largest coordinated conservation tool assigned to maintain the long-term survival of Europe's most significant species and habitats. In attempting to understand the effectiveness of PAs in the face of climate change scenarios, we tested two hypotheses: (1) PAs in the Alpine and the Boreal biogeographical regions will experience more newly emerged climate conditions (hotter and drier) compared to the climate representation of other biogeographical regions under future climate in Europe and (2) PAs in the Mediterranean and the Continental biogeographical regions will face more consistency in climate conditions due to less area of disappearing and novel climate in future. Methods: Current climate data (1960--1990) and projections for 2050 and 2070 of PAs of N2K were extracted from WorldClim global climate data. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed to construct climate space for the PAs across the biogeographical regions based on 19 climatic variables assessed at 5-km resolution. ArcMap 10.1 was used to map the location of the novel and disappearing climates. Results: PAs in the Alpine region will experience more novel climate conditions in the future compared to other biogeographical regions. The future projections showed that 17.70\% of the PAs in the Alpine region will experience novel climate by 2070. Considerable climate consistency was observed in the PAs in the Continental region compared to the other biogeographical regions. Our results showed that about 176 km2 of the selected PAs in the Continental region will face new emerging climate, while about 110 km2 will disappear under RCP 8.5 scenario. The prediction also revealed that in the Mediterranean region 08 PAs will experience novel climate and 786 km2 areas in these PAs will face disappearing climate by 2070. We found that fewer areas of PAs in the Boreal regions will experience disappearing climate in both the scenarios. Conclusions: The portion of novel climate conditions can be seen as a future opportunity to assign new reserves for the species. Our study highlights the importance of conservation planning to increase the connectivity between PAs, identifying novel conservation zones to maximize representation of habitats during the emerging climatic changes as well as designing strategies, management, and monitoring of the individual PAs.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We examined the changes to global net primary production (NPP), vegetation biomass carbon (VegC), and soil organic carbon (SOC) estimated by six global vegetation models (GVMs) obtained from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project. Simulation results were obtained using five global climate models (GCMs) forced with four representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. To clarify which component (i.e., emission scenarios, climate projections, or global vegetation models) contributes the most to uncertainties in projected global terrestrial C cycling by 2100, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and wavelet clustering were applied to 70 projected simulation sets. At the end of the simulation period, changes from the year 2000 in all three variables varied considerably from net negative to positive values. ANOVA revealed that the main sources of uncertainty are different among variables and depend on the projection period. We determined that in the global VegC and SOC projections, GVMs are the main influence on uncertainties (60 \% and 90 \%, respectively) rather than climate-driving scenarios (RCPs and GCMs). Moreover, the divergence of changes in vegetation carbon residence times is dominated by GVM uncertainty, particularly in the latter half of the 21st century. In addition, we found that the contribution of each uncertainty source is spatiotemporally heterogeneous and it differs among the GVM variables. The dominant uncertainty source for changes in NPP and VegC varies along the climatic gradient. The contribution of GVM to the uncertainty decreases as the climate division becomes cooler (from ca. 80 \% in the equatorial division to 40 \% in the snow division). Our results suggest that to assess climate change impacts on global ecosystem C cycling among each RCP scenario, the long-term C dynamics within the ecosystems (i.e., vegetation turnover and soil decomposition) are more critical factors than photosynthetic processes. The different trends in the contribution of uncertainty sources in each variable among climate divisions indicate that improvement of GVMs based on climate division or biome type will be effective. On the other hand, in dry regions, GCMs are the dominant uncertainty source in climate impact assessments of vegetation and soil C dynamics.},

  abstract = {With an increasing fraction of the world's forests being intensively managed for meeting humanity's need for wood, fiber and ecosystem services, quantitative understanding of the functional changes in these ecosystems in comparison with natural forests is needed. In particular, the role of managed forests as long-term carbon (C) sinks and for mitigating climate change require a detailed assessment of their carbon cycle on different temporal scales. In the current review we assess available data on the structure and function of the world's forests, explore the main differences in the C exchange between managed and unmanaged stands, and explore potential physiological mechanisms behind both observed and expected changes. Two global databases that include classification for management indicate that managed forests are about 50. years younger, include 25\% more coniferous stands, and have about 50\% lower C stocks than unmanaged forests. The gross primary productivity (GPP) and total net primary productivity (NPP) are the similar, but relatively more of the assimilated carbon is allocated to aboveground pools in managed than in unmanaged forests, whereas allocation to fine roots and rhizosymbionts is lower. This shift in allocation patterns is promoted by increasing plant size, and by increased nutrient availability. Long-term carbon sequestration potential in soils is assessed through the ratio of heterotrophic respiration to total detritus production, which indicates that (i) the forest soils may be losing more carbon on an annual basis than they regain in detritus, and (ii) the deficit appears to be greater in managed forests. While climate change and management factors (esp. fertilization) both contribute to greater carbon accumulation potential in the soil, the harvest-related increase in decomposition affects the C budget over the entire harvest cycle. Although the findings do not preclude the use of forests for climate mitigation, maximizing merchantable productivity may have significant carbon costs for the soil pool. We conclude that optimal management strategies for maximizing multiple benefits from ecosystem services require better understanding of the dynamics of belowground allocation, carbohydrate availability, heterotrophic respiration, and carbon stabilization in the soil.},

Methods: We measured leaf hydraulic conductance for plants in the field and laboratory under wet, dry, and rewetted conditions and applied physiological, anatomical, and gene expression analysis with modeling to investigate changes in Kleaf. Results: After 7 d with no rain in the field or 14 days with no water in the glasshouse, Kleaf decreased by 50\% yet increased to hydrated values within 4 d of tank refilling. Staining to detect embolism combined with modeling indicated that changes outside the xylem were of greater importance to Kleaf than were changes inside the xylem and were associated with changes in intercellular air spaces (aerenchyma), aquaporin expression and inhibition, and cuticular conductance. Conclusions: Low values for all conductances during drying, particularly in pathways outside the xylem, lead to hydraulic resilience for this species and may also contribute to its broad environmental tolerances.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Understanding uncertainties and sensitivities of projected ecosystem dynamics under environmental change is of immense value for research and climate change policy. Here, we analyze sensitivities (change in model outputs per unit change in inputs) and uncertainties (changes in model outputs scaled to uncertainty in inputs) of vegetation dynamics under climate change, projected by a state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS v4.0) across European forests (the species Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica and Pinus sylvestris), considering uncertainties of both model parameters and environmental drivers. We find that projected forest carbon fluxes are most sensitive to photosynthesis-, water-, and mortality-related parameters, while predictive uncertainties are dominantly induced by environmental drivers and parameters related to water and mortality. The importance of environmental drivers for predictive uncertainty increases with increasing temperature. Moreover, most of the interactions of model inputs (environmental drivers and parameters) are between environmental drivers themselves or between parameters and environmental drivers. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of environmental drivers not only as contributors to predictive uncertainty in their own right but also as modifiers of sensitivities and thus uncertainties in other ecosystem processes. Reducing uncertainty in mortality-related processes and accounting for environmental influence on processes should therefore be a focus in further model development.},

  abstract = {A holm oak forest was exposed to an experimental drought during 5 years to elucidate the growth responses of the dominant species Quercus ilex, Arbutus unedo and Phillyrea latifolia. Soil water availability was partially reduced, about 15\% as predicted for this area for the next decades by GCM and ecophysiological models, by plastic strips intercepting rainfall and by ditch exclusion of water runoff. The stem diameter increment was highly correlated with annual rainfall in all species, and drought treatment strongly reduced the diameter increment of Q. ilex (41\%) and specially of A. unedo (63\%), the species showing higher growth rates. Stem mortality rates were highly correlated with previous stem density, but drought treatment increased mortality rates in all species. Q. ilex showed the highest mortality rates (9\% and 18\% in control and drought plots, respectively), and P. latifolia experienced the lowest mortality rates (1\% and 3\% in control and drought plots, respectively). Drought strongly reduced the increment of live aboveground biomass during these 5 years (83\%). A. unedo and Q. ilex experienced a high reduction in biomass increment by drought, whereas P. latifolia biomass increment was insensitive to drought. The different sensitivity to drought of the dominant species of the holm oak forest may be very important determining their future development and distribution in a drier environment as expected in Mediterranean areas for the next decades. These drier conditions could thus have strong effects on structure (species composition) and functioning (carbon uptake and biomass accumulation) of these Mediterranean forests. {\copyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Multi-aged forest management systems represent a promising approach for increasing resistance and resilience, thereby limiting major disruptions to timber production and other ecosystem services. Multi-aged stands inherently have greater resistance and resilience to disturbances because of the presence of several age classes and more potential pathways for post-disturbance management and recovery. The preponderance of research also indicates few differences in productivity between multi-aged and even-aged management strategies. These factors combined suggest that increased adoption of multi-aged management systems will lead to a reduction in long-term risks. We advocate a disturbance integration management strategy that encourages managers to emulate disturbance effects with management, anticipate disturbances in planning, integrate the management of residual stand structures into salvage operations and build variable treatment intervals or cutting cycles into management regimes. {\copyright} Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2013.

However, some strategies to mitigate GHG emission involve greater land-based mitigation efforts, which may cause biodiversity loss from land-use changes. Here we estimate how climate and land-based mitigation efforts interact with global biodiversity by using an integrated assessment model framework to project potential habitat for five major taxonomic groups. We find that stringent GHG mitigation can generally bring a net benefit to global biodiversity even if land-based mitigation is adopted. This trend is strengthened in the latter half of this century. In contrast, some regions projected to experience much growth in land-based mitigation efforts (i.e., Europe and Oceania) are expected to suffer biodiversity loss. Our results support the enactment of stringent GHG mitigation policies in terms of biodiversity. To conserve local biodiversity, however, these policies must be carefully designed in conjunction with land-use regulations and societal transformation in order to minimize the conversion of natural habitats.},

We assess different aspects of risk arising from future climate change by quantifying changes in the spatial distribution of future climatic conditions compared with the recent past. Location: Europe. Methods: A 10{$\prime$} {\texttimes} 10{$\prime$} resolution gridded data set of five climate variables was used to calculate expected changes to the area, distance and direction of 1931-60 climatic conditions under the HadCM3 climate model for four future climate scenarios based on different rates of greenhouse gas emissions (SRES scenarios). Three levels of tolerance ranges determined the thresholds for which future conditions are considered analogous to 1931-60 (pre-warming) conditions. Results: For many parts of Europe, areas with pre-warming analogous climate conditions will be smaller and further away in the future than they are now. For any location in Europe, areas with pre-warming analogous mean annual temperature conditions will, on average, be reduced between 23.7\% (B1 scenario) and 49.7\% (A1FI scenario) by 2100 when assuming a medium tolerance range. The mean distance to these areas will, on average, increase between 272 km (B1) and 645 km (A1FI). These changes are more pronounced for temperature than for water availability variables and also for narrow tolerance ranges compared to wide tolerance ranges. Using a combined measure of both temperature and precipitation variables, areas with prewarming analogous conditions are predicted to be in a more northeasterly direction in the future, but there are considerable regional differences within Europe. Main conclusions: The results suggest that, for some parts of Europe, the loss of area with any suitable climatic conditions represents the greatest risk to biodiversity, but in other regions the distances that species may have to move to reach suitable climatic conditions may be a greater problem. Quantifying the distance and direction in analyses of change of climatically suitable areas can add additional information for climate change risk assessments. {\copyright} 2006 The Authors Journal compilation {\copyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

This apparent contradiction was investigated using four years of transpiration estimates from sap flux, interception-evaporation estimates from precipitation and throughfall gauges, modeled soil evaporation and drainage estimates, and eddy covariance data in a mature oak-hickory forest in North Carolina, USA. The study period included one severe drought year and one year of well above-average precipitation. Normalized for atmospheric conditions, transpiration rates of some species were lower in drought than in wet periods whereas others did not respond to drought. However, atmospheric conditions during drought periods are unlike conditions during typical growing season periods. The rainy days that are required to maintain drought-free periods are characterized by low atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, leading to very low transpiration. In contrast, days with low air vapor pressure deficit were practically absent during drought and moderate levels of transpiration were maintained throughout despite the drying soil. Thus, integrated over the growing season, canopy transpiration was not reduced by drought. In addition, high vapor pressure deficit during drought periods sustained appreciable soil evaporation rates. As a result, despite the large interannual variation in precipitation (ranging from 934 to 1346 mm), annual evapotranspiration varied little (610-668 mm), increasing only slightly with precipitation, due to increased canopy rainfall interception. Because forest evapotranspiration shows only modest changes with annual precipitation, lower precipitation translates to decreased replenishment of groundwater and outflow, and thus the supply of water to downstream ecosystems and water bodies. {\copyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {Croplands are vital ecosystems for human well-being and provide important ecosystem services such as crop yields, retention of nitrogen and carbon storage. On large (regional to global)-scale levels, assessment of how these different services will vary in space and time, especially in response to cropland management, are scarce. We explore cropland management alternatives and the effect these can have on future C and N pools and fluxes using the land-use-enabled dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS (Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator). Simulated crop production, cropland carbon storage, carbon sequestration and nitrogen leaching from croplands are evaluated and discussed. Compared to the version of LPJ-GUESS that does not include land-use dynamics, estimates of soil carbon stocks and nitrogen leaching from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems were improved. Our model experiments allow us to investigate trade-offs between these ecosystem services that can be provided from agricultural fields. These trade-offs are evaluated for current land use and climate and further explored for future conditions within the two future climate change scenarios, RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 2.6 and 8.5. Our results show that the potential for carbon sequestration due to typical cropland management practices such as no-till management and cover crops proposed in previous studies is not realised, globally or over larger climatic regions. Our results highlight important considerations to be made when modelling C-N interactions in agricultural ecosystems under future environmental change and the effects these have on terrestrial biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Nitrogen (N) is a key element in terrestrial ecosystems as it influences both plant growth and plant interactions with the atmosphere. Accounting for carbon--nitrogen interactions has been found to alter future projections of the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle substantially. Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) aim to accurately represent both natural vegetation and managed land, not only from a carbon cycle perspective but increasingly so also for a wider range of processes including crop yields. We present here the extended version of the DVM LPJ-GUESS that accounts for N limitation in crops to account for the effects of N fertilisation on yields and biogeochemical cycling. The performance of this new implementation is evaluated against observations from N fertiliser trials and CO2 enrichment experiments. LPJ-GUESS captures the observed response to both N and CO2 fertilisation on wheat biomass production, tissue C to N ratios (C : N) and phenology. To test the model's applicability for larger regions, simulations are subsequently performed that cover the wheat-dominated regions of western Europe. When compared to regional yield statistics, the inclusion of C--N dynamics in the model substantially increase the model performance compared to an earlier version of the model that does not account for these interactions. For these simulations, we also demonstrate an implementation of N fertilisation timing for areas where this information is not available. This feature is crucial when accounting for processes in managed ecosystems in large-scale models. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for C--N interactions when modelling agricultural ecosystems, and it is an important step towards accounting for the combined impacts of changes in climate, [CO2] and land use on terrestrial biogeochemical cycles.},

Plants grown outdoors exhibited lower light and CO2-saturated CO2 assimilation rates (Asat) and apparent quantum yield ({$\Phi$}i) than those indoors. Until mid-winter, C. albidus had higher Asat than Q. ilex, but differences disappeared after a period of severe cold. Maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) measured predawn was higher in C. albidus than in Q. ilex, and decreased throughout the season in outdoor plants. Fv/Fm also decreased at light saturation (Asat) in both species. Fv/Fm was correlated with photosynthetic capacity and efficiency (quantum yield), but the resulting regression slopes were different between the two species. At the physiological level, C. albidus seemed to cope better with cold stress than Q. ilex. However, winter stress induced reduction of leaf absorptance, increased leaf mass per area, extensive leaf damage and high plant mortality in C. albidus. This suggests that the high performance of C. albidus leaves is not likely to be maintained for long periods of cold stress, and may therefore depend on continuous leaf replacement. Quercus ilex showed a conservative behaviour, with low net assimilation rates but greater leaf and plant survival than C. albidus. {\copyright} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

  abstract = {Although forest management is one of the instruments proposed to mitigate climate change, the relationship between forest management and canopy albedo has been ignored so far by climate models. Here we develop an approach that could be implemented in Earth system models. A stand-level forest gap model is combined with a canopy radiation transfer model and satellite-derived model parameters to quantify the effects of forest thinning on summertime canopy albedo. This approach reveals which parameter has the largest affect on summer canopy albedo: we examined the effects of three forest species (pine, beech, oak) and four thinning strategies with a constant forest floor albedo (light to intense thinning regimes) and five different solar zenith angles at five different sites (40{$^\circ$} N 9{$^\circ$} E-60{$^\circ$} N 9{$^\circ$} E). During stand establishment, summertime canopy albedo is driven by tree species. In the later stages of stand development, the effect of tree species on summertime canopy albedo decreases in favour of an increasing influence of forest thinning. These trends continue until the end of the rotation, where thinning explains up to 50\% of the variance in near-infrared albedo and up to 70\% of the variance in visible canopy albedo. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} The absolute summertime canopy albedo of all species ranges from 0.03 to 0.06 (visible) and 0.20 to 0.28 (near-infrared); thus the albedo needs to be parameterised at species level. In addition, Earth system models need to account for forest management in such a way that structural changes in the canopy are described by changes in leaf area index and crown volume (maximum change of 0.02 visible and 0.05 near-infrared albedo) and that the expression of albedo depends on the solar zenith angle (maximum change of 0.02 visible and 0.05 near-infrared albedo). Earth system models taking into account these parameters would not only be able to examine the spatial effects of forest management but also the total effects of forest management on climate. {\copyright} 2014 Author(s).},

Liebl. species, which are the main oak species in coppice-originated oak forests. This research was conducted in northern Turkish Thrace, an important coppice-oak area. A total of 474 oak trees at different development stages over different sites were destructively sampled to obtain biomass models of the major oak species in the region. Two main biomass models are established to estimate the biomass components: according to the diameter at breast height (DBH) alone and according to the d2h variable, which is the combined DBH and tree height. The goodness-of-fit statistics of the models are calculated to compare these models. The models that use the DBH alone as an independent variable explain 68--95\% of the variation in the biomass of the tree components. After adding the tree height to the model, the accuracy for the bark-, stem-, and total aboveground-biomass estimates increased, while the accuracy of the foliage- and branch-biomass estimates decreased. Different oak species have different biomass components depending on their development stages. The amount of biomass components in the total aboveground biomass and foliage decreased from 20\% (SDF) to 4\% (LDF), the amount of bark decreased from 17\% (SDF) to 12\% (LDF), and the amount of stems increased from 42\% (SDF) to 66\% (LDF) when increasing the mean DBH of the sample plots.},

  abstract = {Past and present pressures on forest resources have led to a drastic decrease in the surface area of unmanaged forests in Europe. Changes in forest structure, composition, and dynamics inevitably lead to changes in the biodiversity of forest-dwelling species. The possible biodiversity gains and losses due to forest management (i.e., anthropogenic pressures related to direct forest resource use), however, have never been assessed at a pan-European scale. We used meta-analysis to review 49 published papers containing 120 individual comparisons of species richness between unmanaged and managed forests throughout Europe. We explored the response of different taxonomic groups and the variability of their response with respect to time since abandonment and intensity of forest management. Species richness was slightly higher in unmanaged than in managed forests. Species dependent on forest cover continuity, deadwood, and large trees (bryophytes, lichens, fungi, saproxylic beetles) and carabids were negatively affected by forest management. In contrast, vascular plant species were favored. The response for birds was heterogeneous and probably depended more on factors such as landscape patterns. The global difference in species richness between unmanaged and managed forests increased with time since abandonment and indicated a gradual recovery of biodiversity. Clearcut forests in which the composition of tree species changed had the strongest effect on species richness, but the effects of different types of management on taxa could not be assessed in a robust way because of low numbers of replications in the management-intensity classes. Our results show that some taxa are more affected by forestry than others, but there is a need for research into poorly studied species groups in Europe and in particular locations. Our meta-analysis supports the need for a coordinated European research network to study and monitor the biodiversity of different taxa in managed and unmanaged forests. {\copyright} 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is critical in linking global water, carbon and energy cycles. However, direct measurement of global terrestrial ET is not feasible. Here, we first reviewed the basic theory and state-of-the-art approaches for estimating global terrestrial ET, including remote-sensingbased physical models, machine-learning algorithms and land surface models (LSMs). We then utilized 4 remotesensing-based physical models, 2 machine-learning algorithms and 14 LSMs to analyze the spatial and temporal variations in global terrestrial ET. The results showed that the ensemble means of annual global terrestrial ET estimated by these three categories of approaches agreed well, with values ranging from 589.6 mm yr-1 (6.56 {\texttimes} 104 km3 yr-1) to 617.1 mm yr-1 (6.87 {\texttimes} 104 km3 yr-1). For the period from 1982 to 2011, both the ensembles of remote-sensing-based physical models and machine-learning algorithms suggested increasing trends in global terrestrial ET (0.62 mm yr-2 with a significance level of p {$<$} 0.05 and 0.38 mm yr-2 with a significance level of p {$<$} 0.05, respectively). In contrast, the ensemble mean of the LSMs showed no statistically significant change (0.23 mm yr-2, p {$>$} 0.05), although many of the individual LSMs reproduced an increasing trend. Nevertheless, all 20 models used in this study showed that anthropogenic Earth greening had a positive role in increasing terrestrial ET. The concurrent small interannual variability, i.e., relative stability, found in all estimates of global terrestrial ET, suggests that a potential planetary boundary exists in regulating global terrestrial ET, with the value of this boundary being around 600 mm yr-1. Uncertainties among approaches were identified in specific regions, particularly in the Amazon Basin and arid/semiarid regions. Improvements in parameterizing water stress and canopy dynamics, the utilization of new available satellite retrievals and deep-learning methods, and model-data fusion will advance our predictive understanding of global terrestrial ET.},

  abstract = {Vegetation responds to drought through a complex interplay of plant hydraulic mechanisms, posing challenges for model development and parameterization. We present a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of leaf water-potential over time while considering different strategies by which plant species regulate their water-potentials. The model has two parameters: the parameter {$\lambda$} describing the adjustment of the leaf water potential to changes in soil water potential, and the parameter {$\Delta\psi$}ww describing the typical `well-watered' leaf water potentials at non-stressed (near-zero) levels of soil water potential. Our model was tested and calibrated on 110 time-series datasets containing the leaf- and soil water potentials of 66 species under drought and non-drought conditions. Our model successfully reproduces the measured leaf water potentials over time based on three different regulation strategies under drought. We found that three parameter sets derived from the measurement data reproduced the dynamics of 53\% of an drought dataset, and 52\% of a control dataset [root mean square error (RMSE) {$<$} 0.5 MPa)]. We conclude that, instead of quantifying water-potential-regulation of different plant species by complex modeling approaches, a small set of parameters may be sufficient to describe the water potential regulation behavior for large-scale modeling. Thus, our approach paves the way for a parsimonious representation of the full spectrum of plant hydraulic responses to drought in dynamic vegetation models.},

  abstract = {The atmospheric nitrous oxide mixing ratio has increased by 20\% since 1750 (ref.1). Given that nitrous oxide is both a long-lived greenhouse gas 2 and a stratospheric ozone-depleting substance, this increase is of global concern. However, the magnitude and geographic distribution of nitrous oxide sources, and how they have changed over time, is uncertain 4,5. A key unknown is the influence of the stratospheric circulation 4,5, which brings air depleted in nitrous oxide to the surface. Here, we report the oxygen and intramolecular nitrogen isotopic compositions of nitrous oxide in firn air samples from Antarctica and archived air samples from Cape Grim, Tasmania, spanning 1940-2005. We detect seasonal cycles in the isotopic composition of nitrous oxide at Cape Grim. The phases and amplitudes of these seasonal cycles allow us to distinguish between the influence of the stratospheric sink and the oceanic source at this site, demonstrating that isotope measurements can help in the attribution and quantification of surface sources in general. Large interannual variations and long-term decreasing trends in isotope composition are also apparent. These long-term trends allow us to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic sources of nitrous oxide, and confirm that the rise in atmospheric nitrous oxide levels is largely the result of an increased reliance on nitrogen-based fertilizers. {\copyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In particular, the temperate forest biome has traditionally been defined as dense, closed-canopy forest; however, some argue that large herbivores maintained greater openness or even wood-pasture conditions. Here, we address this question for the Last Interglacial period (129,000--116,000 years ago), before Homo sapiens --linked megafauna declines and anthropogenic landscape transformation. We applied the vegetation reconstruction method REVEALS to 96 Last Interglacial pollen records. We found that light woodland and open vegetation represented, on average, more than 50\% cover during this period. The degree of openness was highly variable and only partially linked to climatic factors, indicating the importance of natural disturbance regimes. Our results show that the temperate forest biome was historically heterogeneous rather than uniformly dense, which is consistent with the dependency of much of contemporary European biodiversity on open vegetation and light woodland.},

If this tendency continues, it seems increasingly less likely that future emissions will follow current high-emission scenarios. However, in the past, periods of slow and fast global emissions growth was observed, which have led to previous critiques of scenarios being too low or too high. In the light of such unpredictability and since scenarios are meant to explore plausible futures, we here argue that a broad range of emission scenarios continue to be considered input in scenario-based analyses of future climate change. Furthermore, we find substantial regional differences in emissions trends. Territorial emissions in OECD countries fall on the low side of emission scenario ranges, whereas non-OECD territorial emissions fell closer to the medium or high-end. Since non-OECD emissions will become increasingly important, we recommend further exploring the relationships between regional and global emissions to support scenario assumptions and climate policymaking.},

However, recreational activities also created negative feedback, affecting the ecosystem, biodiversity and CES, most frequently in the form of various touristic activities. Suggested solutions were most commonly socio-economic and institutional measures to enhance rural communities, as well as improving communication with relevant stakeholders. CES play a crucial role in reconnecting people with nature, and their consequent acknowledgement and incorporation into future ecosystem service frameworks and agri-environmental policy developments are key elements in supporting future sustainable grassland management.},

  abstract = {Variation in antecedent (past) climate conditions is likely to govern tree growth over long periods of time. Antecedent conditions are rarely considered in models of tree growth, representing a weakness in quantitative understanding of forest responses to climate variations. We applied the stochastic antecedent modelling (SAM) framework to 367 International Tree Ring Data Bank chronologies in the southwestern US (``Southwest'') representing eight conifer species. To better understand climatic and physiologic controls on tree growth, we quantify the effects of antecedent precipitation, temperature and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) over 60~months preceding and including the year of ring formation. In Pinus edulis, Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii, growth responded primarily to recent precipitation and temperature conditions (43\%--49\% of the response was driven by conditions during the year of ring formation), but to less recent PDSI conditions ({$>$}50\% of response driven by conditions 13--48~months prior to the year of ring formation), though PDSI significantly affected growth at only 21\% of sites. Combining extensive tree-ring data with monthly resolution climate data also reveals key climatic events, such as the effect of monsoon arrival date on growth, especially in P.~menziesii, highlighting the ability of the SAM framework to identify climate effects at multiple time-scales. Sensitivity to antecedent climate, baseline growth at average climate conditions and the strength of first order autocorrelation varied spatially, suggesting variation in mean growing conditions, non-structural carbohydrate storage, and/or seasonal precipitation contribution of the North American Monsoon may drive differences in growth sensitivities across species' ranges. Synthesis. Our findings provide further evidence for multi-year legacy effects of climate conditions, particularly drought metrics, on tree growth. Antecedent climate and especially drought are key drivers of growth in these species, and associated climatic sensitivities and growth indices vary spatially. We argue such factors should be considered in modelling efforts. The spatial variability in antecedent climate sensitivities points to key differences in how different populations within a species range may respond to climate change, particularly if timing of weather events, such as monsoon arrival date, or annual precipitation amounts undergoes significant changes.},

  abstract = {Forest soils store a substantial amount of carbon, often more than the forest vegetation does. Estimates of the amount of soil carbon, and in particular estimates of changes in these amounts are still inaccurate. Measuring soil carbon is laborious, and measurements taken at a few statistically unrepresentative sites are difficult to scale to larger areas. We combined a simple dynamic model of soil carbon with litter production estimated on the basis of stand parameters, models of tree allometry and biomass turnover rates of different biomass components. This integrated method was used to simulate soil carbon as forest stands develop. The results were compared with measurements of soil carbon from 64 forest sites in southern Finland. Measured carbon stocks in the organic soil layer increased by an average of 4.7 {\textpm} 1.4 g m-2a-1 with increasing stand age and no significant changes were measured in the amount of carbon in mineral soil. Our integrated method indicated that soil carbon stocks declined to a minimum 20 years after clear-cutting and the subsequent increase in the soil carbon stock (F/H - 1m) was 5.8 {\textpm} 1.0 g m -2a-1 averaged over the period to next harvesting ({$\sim$}125 years). Simulated soil carbon accumulation slowed down considerably in stands older than 50 years. The carbon stock measured (F/H - 1 m) for the study area averaged 6.8 {\textpm} 2.5kg m 2. The simulated carbon stock in soil was 7.0 {\textpm} 0.6kg m-2 on average. These tests of the validity of the integrated model suggest that this method is suitable for estimating the amount of carbon in soil and its changes on regional scales. {\copyright} 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {After agriculture, wood harvest is the human activity that has most reduced the storage of carbon in vegetation and soils1,2. Although felled wood releases carbon to the atmosphere in various steps, the fact that growing trees absorb carbon has led to different carbon-accounting approaches for wood use, producing widely varying estimates of carbon costs. Many approaches give the impression of low, zero or even negative greenhouse gas emissions from wood harvests because, in different ways, they offset carbon losses from new harvests with carbon sequestration from growth of broad forest areas3,4. Attributing this sequestration to new harvests is inappropriate because this other forest growth would occur regardless of new harvests and typically results from agricultural abandonment, recovery from previous harvests and climate change itself. Nevertheless some papers count gross emissions annually, which assigns no value to the capacity of newly harvested forests to regrow and approach the carbon stocks of unharvested forests. Here we present results of a new model that uses time discounting to estimate the present and future carbon costs of global wood harvests under different scenarios. We find that forest harvests between 2010 and 2050 will probably have annualized carbon costs of 3.5--4.2 Gt CO2e yr-1, which approach common estimates of annual emissions from land-use change due to agricultural expansion. Our study suggests an underappreciated option to address climate change by reducing these costs.},

Here, we review current scientific knowledge on global biodiversity change and identify the main knowledge gaps. We discuss two components of biodiversity change-biodiversity alterations and biodiversity loss-across four dimensions of biodiversity: species extinctions, species abundances, species distributions, and genetic diversity. We briefly review the impacts that modern humans and their ancestors have had on biodiversity and discuss the recent declines and alterations in biodiversity. We analyze the direct pressures on biodiversity change: habitat change, overexploitation, exotic species, pollution, and climate change. We discuss the underlying causes, such as demographic growth and resource use, and review existing scenario projections. We identify successes and impending opportunities in biodiversity policy and management, and highlight gaps in biodiversity monitoring and models. Finally, we discuss how the ecosystem services framework can be used to identify undesirable biodiversity change and allocate conservation efforts. {\copyright} Copyright {\copyright}2012 by Annual Reviews.

  abstract = {Based on an extensive model intercomparison, we assessed trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services from historical reconstructions and future scenarios of land-use and climate change. During the 20th century, biodiversity declined globally by 2 to 11\%, as estimated by a range of indicators. Provisioning ecosystem services increased several fold, and regulating services decreased moderately. Going forward, policies toward sustainability have the potential to slow biodiversity loss resulting from land-use change and the demand for provisioning services while reducing or reversing declines in regulating services. However, negative impacts on biodiversity due to climate change appear poised to increase, particularly in the higher-emissions scenarios. Our assessment identifies remaining modeling uncertainties but also robustly shows that renewed policy efforts are needed to meet the goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity.           ,              Editor's summary                            The 20th century saw rates of biodiversity loss high enough to qualify as a sixth mass extinction. Climate change now further threatens species and ecosystem services. Pereira               et al               . forecasted changes in both biodiversity loss and ecosystem services to 2050 and compared them with changes from 1900 to 2015, combining results from 13 different models. Across three shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios, rates of biodiversity decline from land-use change are expected to be lower than in the 20th century but much higher when climate change is considered. Provisioning ecosystem services (i.e., materials) are expected to increase, but regulating services (e.g., pollination) decline under most scenarios. Outcomes depend on the scenario, suggesting that policies can make a difference. ---Bianca Lopez},

Karst.), in three catchment areas within the Lake G{\aa}rdsj{\"o}n basin, SW Sweden. The catchment areas were subjected to decreased N- and S-deposition (G1 ROOF), increased N-deposition (G2 NITREX) and ambient levels of N- and S-deposition (F1 CONTROL). The excavated fine-roots ({$<$}1 mm in diameter) were separated into live and dead fractions and chemical analyses were carried out. The proportion of nitrogen to other macro-nutrients in the fine-roots was used as an indicator of mineral nutrient requirements of the forest trees. The most 'vital' fine-roots (characterised by high live to dead ratio) were found in all catchment areas in the upper parts of the organic soil horizon, which most frequently exhibited good mineral nutrient and soil water conditions. It was concluded from available climatic data on monthly precipitation and air temperature that the variation in fine-root growth was not caused by climatic changes. The live to dead ratio of the fine-roots gradually decreased with depth and was low in the mineral soil horizon. An increased percentage of living fine-roots in the ROOF catchment suggests an increased 'vitality' in fine-roots (increased live to dead ratios), associated with reduced N- and S-deposition. Chemical analyses of live fine-roots in the same area revealed improved mineral nutrient concentrations, e.g. higher Ca/Al ratios, increased concentrations of K, P, Ca and Mg. Fine-root vitality was improved in the NITREX catchment area, probably as a result of an increased cation release. Fine-root distributions, live to dead ratios and mineral nutrient concentrations appear to be strongly affected by N availability in the soil. Increased concentrations of K and P in proportion to N in fine-roots in the ROOF catchment indicate improved mineral nutrient conditions and lower risk of ion-imbalances. The results are in agreement with findings from other investigations suggesting those nutrient deficiencies and/or metal toxicity may strongly affect the growth of fine-roots. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Yet, details are missing on how to track progress towards the {\^a} {\texteuro} Paris goal', inform the five-yearly {\^a} {\texteuro} global stocktake', and increase the ambition of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We develop a nested structure of key indicators to track progress through time. Global emissions track aggregated progress, country-level decompositions track emerging trends that link directly to NDCs, and technology diffusion indicates future reductions. We find the recent slowdown in global emissions growth is due to reduced growth in coal use since 2011, primarily in China and secondarily in the United States. The slowdown is projected to continue in 2016, with global CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry similar to the 2015 level of 36 GtCO 2. Explosive and policy-driven growth in wind and solar has contributed to the global emissions slowdown, but has been less important than economic factors and energy efficiency. We show that many key indicators are currently broadly consistent with emission scenarios that keep temperatures below 2 {$^\circ$}C, but the continued lack of large-scale carbon capture and storage threatens 2030 targets and the longer-term Paris ambition of net-zero emissions.},

Plants respond to droughts by partially closing their stomata to limit their evaporative water loss, at the expense of carbon uptake by photosynthesis. This trade-off maximizes their water-use efficiency (WUE), as measured for many individual plants under laboratory conditions and field experiments. Here we analyse the 13C/12C stable isotope ratio in atmospheric CO2 to provide new observational evidence of the impact of droughts on the WUE across areas of millions of square kilometres and spanning one decade of recent climate variability. We find strong and spatially coherent increases in WUE along with widespread reductions of net carbon uptake over the Northern Hemisphere during severe droughts that affected Europe, Russia and the United States in 2001--2011. The impact of those droughts on WUE and carbon uptake by vegetation is substantially larger than simulated by the land-surface schemes of six state-of-the-art climate models. This suggests that drought-induced carbon--climate feedbacks may be too small in these models and improvements to their vegetation dynamics using stable isotope observations can help to improve their drought response.},

  abstract = {Background. Uncertainty about climate change impacts on forests can hinder mitigation and adaptation actions. Scientific enquiry typically involves assessments of uncertainties, yet different uncertainty components emerge in different studies. Consequently, inconsistent understanding of uncertainty among different climate impact studies (from the impact analysis to implementing solutions) can be an additional reason for delaying action. In this review we (a) expanded existing uncertainty assessment frameworks into one harmonised framework for characterizing uncertainty, (b) used this framework to identify and classify uncertainties in climate change impacts studies on forests, and (c) summarised the uncertainty assessment methods applied in those studies. Methods. We systematically reviewed climate change impact studies published between 1994 and 2016. We separated these studies into those generating information about climate change impacts on forests using models --`modelling studies', and those that used this information to design management actions---`decision-making studies'. We classified uncertainty across three dimensions: nature, level, and location, which can be further categorised into specific uncertainty types. Results. We found that different uncertainties prevail in modelling versus decision-making studies. Epistemic uncertainty is the most common nature of uncertainty covered by both types of studies, whereas ambiguity plays a pronounced role only in decision-making studies. Modelling studies equally investigate all levels of uncertainty, whereas decision-making studies mainly address scenario uncertainty and recognised ignorance. Finally, the main location of uncertainty for both modelling and decision-making studies is within the driving forces---representing, e.g. socioeconomic or policy changes. The most frequently used methods to assess uncertainty are expert elicitation, sensitivity and scenario analysis, but a full suite of methods exists that seems currently underutilized. Discussion \& Synthesis. The misalignment of uncertainty types addressed by modelling and decision-making studies may complicate adaptation actions early in the implementation pathway. Furthermore, these differences can be a potential barrier for communicating research findings to decision-makers.},

In response, Brazil developed public policies such as the new Forest Code (FC) and supply chain arrangements such the Soy and the Cattle Moratoriums. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of these policies, considering the trajectories of agricultural expansion in the state of Mato Grosso in three years: 2005 (pre-moratorium and before the new FC), 2010 (post-moratorium and before the new FC) and 2017 (post-moratorium and post-new FC). Our analysis uses a detailed land use change data for both the Amazon and Cerrado biomes in Mato Grosso. In all the years considered, soybean expansion occurred in consolidated production areas and by conversion of pastures. Pasture expansion is influenced by existence of pastures nearby, by areas of secondary vegetation and deforestation. Our data and models show the effectiveness of public policies and private arrangements to reduce direct conversion from forests to crop production. However, our results also provide evidence that soybean expansion has caused indirect impacts by replacing pasture areas and causing pasture expansion elsewhere. Evidence from our work indicates that Brazil needs broader-ranging land use policies than what was done in the 2010s to be able to reach the land use goals stated in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement.},

In P. pinaster, decreasing A in response to drought was associated with increasing plant intrinsic water use efficiency (A/g) and with decreasing calculated intercellular [CO2] (Ci), suggesting a stomatal limitation of A. In contrast, in Q. petraea, A/g declined and Ci increased during the drying cycle, which suggests a non-stomatal origin for the decrease in A. In P. pinaster, a negative relationship was observed between the gas exchange-derived values of Ci/Ca and {$\delta$}13C, which conforms to the classical two-step carbon isotope discrimination model. In Q. petraea, the relationship between Ci/Ca and {$\delta$}13C was positive. Possible causes of this discrepancy are discussed. Lower g values were observed under elevated [CO2] than under present [CO2] in Q. petraea, whereas g was unaffected in P. pinaster. A stimulation of A by elevated [CO2] was found in P. pinaster but not in Q. petraea. In both species, A/g was markedly higher under elevated than under present [CO2]. Whether the differences in the g response to elevated [CO2] found here can be generalized to other drought-avoiding and non-avoiding species remains to be assessed.},

In response, adaptation projects across the region have attempted to reduce exposure and overall vulnerability to these coastal pressures. This paper explores what happens once these projects reach communities: are effective and sustainable outcomes achieved, or can the implementation of adaptation projects lead to unintended negative outcomes and result in maladaptation? This paper investigates this issue in relation to two seawall projects implemented in communities on Vanua Levu Island, Fiji. We found that the seawalls have not been successful in achieving their primary aim of safeguarding communities against coastal pressures and have instead resulted in unanticipated negative outcomes for land and livelihood security. Of primary concern is the way that seawalls trap water along their landward sides---acting more like a dam---because of the ineffective design and construction of the seawalls and associated infrastructure. This paper concludes with a call to think more long-term about site-specific adaptation measures that actively involve and are driven by local perspectives in the planning, implementation, and maintenance process.},

Overall, increasing the forest conservation area decreased timber yield and increased the ecosystem carbon stock, the amount of dead wood and consequently the area of suitable habitat for saproxylic species. The use of intensified forest management reduced the loss of timber yield, increased ecosystem carbon stock, the amount of dead wood and area of suitable habitat for saproxylic species. At the end of simulation period, the use of intensified forest management even overcompensated (4--6\% higher) the timber loss from 10\% increase of conservation area. Under changing climate, timber yield, the amount of dead wood and the area of suitable habitats for saproxylic species increased. To conclude, with intensified forest management it is possible, in the short term, to decrease the loss of timber yield through increased forest conservation area and in the long term maintain or even increase it compared to baseline forest management.},

  abstract = {The comprehensive analysis of carbon stocks and fluxes of managed European forests is a prerequisite to quantify their role in biomass production and climate change mitigation. We applied the Carbon Budget Model (CBM) to 26 European countries, parameterized with country information on the historical forest age structure, management practices, harvest regimes and the main natural disturbances. We modeled the C stocks for the five forest pools plus harvested wood products (HWPs) and the fluxes among these pools from 2000 to 2030. The aim is to quantify, using a consistent modeling framework for all 26 countries, the main C fluxes as affected by land-use changes, natural disturbances and forest management and to assess the impact of specific harvest and afforestation scenarios after 2012 on the mitigation potential of the EU forest sector. Substitution effects and the possible impacts of climate are not included in this analysis. Results show that for the historical period from 2000 to 2012 the net primary productivity (NPP) of the forest pools at the EU level is on average equal to 639 Tg C yr-1. The losses are dominated by heterotrophic respiration (409 Tg C yr-1) and removals (110 Tg C yr-1), with direct fire emissions being only 1 Tg C yr-1, leading to a net carbon stock change (i.e., sink) of 110 Tg C yr-1. Fellings also transferred 28 Tg C yr-1 of harvest residues from biomass to dead organic matter pools. The average annual net sector exchange (NSE) of the forest system, i.e., the carbon stock changes in the forest pools including HWP, equals a sink of 122 Tg C yr-1 (i.e., about 19 \% of the NPP) for the historical period, and in 2030 it reaches 126, 101 and 151 Tg C yr-1, assuming constant, increasing (+20 \%) and decreasing (-20 \%) scenarios, respectively, of both harvest and afforestation rates compared to the historical period. Under the constant harvest rate scenario, our findings show an incipient aging process of the forests existing in 1990: although NPP increases (+7 \%), heterotrophic respiration increases at a greater rate (+13 \%) and this leads to a decrease in the sink in the forest pools (-6 \%) in 2030 compared to the historical period. By comparing the evolution of the biomass as a function of the NPP (i.e., the turnover time) for each country, we highlighted at least three groups of countries and turnover times. This means that, contrary to the assumptions proposed by other authors, this relationship cannot be assumed as a constant for all the EU countries, but specific conditions, such as the harvest rate, the current age structure and the forest composition, may contribute to the country-specific evolution of biomass stocks. The detailed picture of the C fluxes condensed in this study, and their evolution under different harvest scenarios, may represent both a benchmark for similar studies and a basis for broader analyses (e.g., including substitution effects of wood) on the mitigation potential of the EU forest sector.},

However, current large-scale maps show strong disparities, despite good validation statistics of their underlying models. Here, we attribute this contradiction to a flaw in the validation methods, which ignore spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in data, leading to overoptimistic assessment of model predictive power. To illustrate this issue, we reproduce the approach of large-scale mapping studies using a massive forest inventory dataset of 11.8 million trees in central Africa to train and validate a random forest model based on multispectral and environmental variables. A standard nonspatial validation method suggests that the model predicts more than half of the forest biomass variation, while spatial validation methods accounting for SAC reveal quasi-null predictive power. This study underscores how a common practice in big data mapping studies shows an apparent high predictive power, even when predictors have poor relationships with the ecological variable of interest, thus possibly leading to erroneous maps and interpretations.},

Diverse indicators have different units of measurement, and normalization is the procedure employed to transform differing indicator measures onto similar scales or to unit-free measures. Given the inherent complexity entailed in interpreting information related to multiple indicators, normalization and aggregation of sustainability indicators are common steps after indicator measures are quantified. However, it is often difficult for stakeholders to make clear connections between specific indicator measurements and resulting aggregate scores of sustainability. Motivated by challenges and examples in sustainability assessment, this paper explores various normalization schemes including ratio normalization, target normalization, Z-score normalization, and unit equivalence normalization. Methods for analyzing the impacts of normalization choice on aggregate scores are presented. Techniques are derived for general application in studying composite indicators, and advantages and drawbacks associated with different normalization schemes are discussed within the context of sustainability assessment. Theoretical results are clarified through a case study using data from indicators of progress towards bioenergy sustainability.},

  abstract = {Humans have substantially modified the Earth's land cover, especially by transforming natural ecosystems to agricultural areas. In preindustrial times, the expansion of agriculture was probably the dominant process by which humankind altered the Earth system, but little is known about its extent, timing, and spatial pattern. This study presents an approach to reconstruct spatially explicit changes in global agricultural areas (cropland and pasture) and the resulting changes in land cover over the last millennium. The reconstruction is based on published maps of agricultural areas for the last three centuries. For earlier times, a country-based method is developed that uses population data as a proxy for agricultural activity. With this approach, the extent of cropland and pasture is consistently estimated since AD 800. The resulting reconstruction of agricultural areas is combined with a map of potential vegetation to estimate the resulting historical changes in land cover. Uncertainties associated with this approach, in particular owing to technological progress in agriculture and uncertainties in population estimates, are quantified. About 5 million km2 of natural vegetation are found to be transformed to agriculture between AD 800 and 1700, slightly more to cropland (mainly at the expense of forested area) than to pasture (mainly at the expense of natural grasslands). Historical events such as the Black Death in Europe led to considerable dynamics in land cover change on a regional scale. The reconstruction can be used with global climate and ecosystem models to assess the impact of human activities on the Earth system in preindustrial times.

  abstract = {Transient simulations are performed over the entire last millennium with a general circulation model that couples the atmosphere, ocean, and the land surface with a closed carbon cycle. This setup applies a high-detail reconstruction of anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) as the only forcing to the climate system with two goals: (1) to isolate the effects of ALCC on the carbon cycle and the climate independently of any other natural and anthropogenic disturbance and (2) to assess the importance of preindustrial human activities. With ALCC as only forcing, the terrestrial biosphere experiences a net loss of 96 Gt C over the last millennium, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO2 by 20 ppm. The biosphere-atmosphere coupling thereby leads to a restoration of 37\% and 48\% of the primary emissions over the industrial (A.D. 1850-2000) and the preindustrial period (A.D. 800-1850), respectively. Because of the stronger coupling flux over the preindustrial period, only 21\% of the 53 Gt C preindustrial emissions remain airborne. Despite the low airborne fraction, atmospheric CO2 rises above natural variability by late medieval times. This suggests that human influence on CO2 began prior to industrialization. Global mean temperatures, however, are not significantly altered until the strong population growth in the industrial period. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of historic events such as epidemics and warfare on the carbon budget. We find that only long-lasting events such as the Mongol invasion lead to carbon sequestration. The reason for this limited carbon sequestration is indirect emissions from past ALCC that compensate carbon uptake in regrowing vegetation for several decades. Drops in ice core CO2 are thus unlikely to be attributable to human action. Our results indicate that climate-carbon cycle studies for present and future centuries, which usually start from an equilibrium state around 1850, start from a significantly disturbed state of the carbon cycle.

Major uncertainty results from the often counteracting temperature responses to biogeochemical as compared to biogeophysical effects. Here, we separate the strength of these two effects for ALCC during the last millennium. We add unprecedented detail by (i) using a coupled atmosphere/ocean general circulation model (GCM), and (ii) applying a high-detail reconstruction of historical ALCC. We find that biogeophysical effects have a slight cooling influence on global mean temperature (-0.03 K in the 20th century), while biogeochemical effects lead to strong warming (0.16-0.18 K). During the industrial era, both effects cause significant changes in certain regions; only few regions, however, experience biogeophysical cooling strong enough to dominate the overall temperature response. This study therefore suggests that the climate response to historical ALCC, both globally and in most regions, is dominated by the rise in CO2 caused by ALCC emissions.

Intentional deflection of sunlight away from the Earth could diminish the amount of climate change in a high-CO 2 world. However, it has been suggested that this diminution would come at the cost of threatening the food and water supply for billions of people. Here, we carry out high-CO 2, geoengineering and control simulations using two climate models to predict the effects on global crop yields. We find that in our models solar-radiation geoengineering in a high-CO 2 climate generally causes crop yields to increase, largely because temperature stresses are diminished while the benefits of CO 2 fertilization are retained. Nevertheless, possible yield losses on the local scale as well as known and unknown side effects and risks associated with geoengineering indicate that the most certain way to reduce climate risks to global food security is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. {\copyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {One of the many debates about sustainability centers on how a natural resource stock (e.g. a forest) generates flows of desired human services (such as lumber and recreation). Should resources be sustained as they currently exist or should the services that they provide be sustained? This is a difficult question to address since there is very little quantitative information available. The purpose of this study was to address this question by using information from an empirical study that was able to look at sustainability when there is one output and extend that framework to a multiobjective setting. We then discuss the framework by using a multiobjective resource, the Neuse River in North Carolina. We identified several concepts from the single objective study, including that there are at least three important types of resource stocks, two types of goals, substitutes for natural resources, and a need to consider uncertainty and reversibility. An index of resource quality was used in a production model, which also allowed substitution of manufactured inputs to achieve the sustainability objective over long periods of time. The relationship between resource quality, manufactured inputs and output over time proved critical to meeting sustainability definitions and varied from one resource to another. When we expanded the framework, we found that constructing indices for one resource output might reveal that it is positively or negatively correlated to another output. For example, an index for drinking water might be made better through an indicator that is a positive, or negative, input into another index such as fishability. Sustainability should consider what is being sustained - i.e. stock, flow or something else, and be inclusive enough to account for multiple services, lest governments will under fund conservation (when services are positively correlated) or waste money by competing one objective against another (when they are negatively correlated) - addressing one objective through some policy requires more money in another government program to fix a problem that the first program caused. It should also be dynamic to allow for changes in relationships over time. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The increasing prices and environmental impacts of fossil fuels have made the production of biofuels to reach unprecedented volumes over the last 15 years. Given the increasing land requirement for biofuel production, the assessment of the impacts that extensive biofuel production may cause to food supply and to the environment has considerable importance. Agriculture faces some major inter-connected challenges in delivering food security at a time of increasing pressures from population growth, changing consumption patterns and dietary preferences, and post-harvest losses. At the same time, there are growing opportunities and demands for the use of biomass to provide additional renewables, energy for heat, power and fuel, pharmaceuticals and green chemical feedstocks. Biomass from cellulosic bioenergy crops is expected to play a substantial role in future energy systems. However, the worldwide potential of bioenergy is limited, because all land is multi-functional and land is also needed for food, feed, timber, and fiber production, and for nature conservation and climate protection. Furthermore, the potential of bioenergy for climate change mitigation remains unclear due to large uncertainties about future agricultural yield improvements and land availability for biomass plantations. Large-scale cultivation of dedicated biomass is likely to affect bioenergy potentials, global food prices and water scarcity. Therefore, integrated policies for energy, land use and water management are needed. As biomass contains all the elements found in fossil resources, albeit in different combinations, therefore present and developing technologies can lead to a future based on renewable, sustainable and low carbon economies. This article presents [1] risks to food and energy security [2] estimates of bioenergy potential with regard to biofuel production, and [3] the challenges of the environmental impact. {\copyright} 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract = {In the future, the land system will be facing new intersecting challenges. While food demand, especially for resource-intensive livestock based commodities, is expected to increase, the terrestrial system has large potentials for climate change mitigation through improved agricultural management, providing biomass for bioenergy, and conserving or even enhancing carbon stocks of ecosystems. However, uncertainties in future socio-economic land use drivers may result in very different land-use dynamics and consequences for land-based ecosystem services. This is the first study with a systematic interpretation of the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) in terms of possible land-use changes and their consequences for the agricultural system, food provision and prices as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, five alternative Integrated Assessment Models with distinctive land-use modules have been used for the translation of the SSP narratives into quantitative projections. The model results reflect the general storylines of the SSPs and indicate a broad range of potential land-use futures with global agricultural land of 4900 mio ha in 2005 decreasing by 743 mio ha until 2100 at the lower (SSP1) and increasing by 1080 mio ha (SSP3) at the upper end. Greenhouse gas emissions from land use and land use change, as a direct outcome of these diverse land-use dynamics, and agricultural production systems differ strongly across SSPs (e.g. cumulative land use change emissions between 2005 and 2100 range from -54 to 402 Gt CO2). The inclusion of land-based mitigation efforts, particularly those in the most ambitious mitigation scenarios, further broadens the range of potential land futures and can strongly affect greenhouse gas dynamics and food prices. In general, it can be concluded that low demand for agricultural commodities, rapid growth in agricultural productivity and globalized trade, all most pronounced in a SSP1 world, have the potential to enhance the extent of natural ecosystems, lead to lowest greenhouse gas emissions from the land system and decrease food prices over time. The SSP-based land use pathways presented in this paper aim at supporting future climate research and provide the basis for further regional integrated assessments, biodiversity research and climate impact analysis.},

Recent advances in remote sensing methods enable detection of ChlaF induced by sunlight across a range of larger scales, from using instruments mounted on towers above plant canopies to Earth-orbiting satellites. This signal is referred to as solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) and its application promises to overcome spatial constraints on studies of photosynthesis, opening new research directions and opportunities in ecology, ecophysiology, biogeochemistry, agriculture and forestry. However, to unleash the full potential of SIF, intensive cross-disciplinary work is required to harmonize these new advances with the rich history of biophysical and ecophysiological studies of ChlaF, fostering the development of next-generation plant physiological and Earth-system models. Here, we introduce the scale-dependent link between SIF and photosynthesis, with an emphasis on seven remaining scientific challenges, and present a roadmap to facilitate future collaborative research towards new applications of SIF.},

The degree of interaction between the different scientific approaches still falls far short of optimal; thus, DGVM developers have a responsibility to be aware of progress in several disciplines in order to ensure that their models remain state-of-the-art. We have presented a series of case studies of the evaluation of DGVMs that demonstrate the predictive capability that current models have achieved. Nevertheless, there are plenty of unresolved issues ? differences among models that are not well understood, important processes that are omitted or treated simplistically by some or all models, and sets of observations that are not satisfactorily reproduced by current models. More comprehensive ?benchmarking? of DGVMs against multiple data sets is required and would be most effectively carried out through an international consortium, so as to avoid duplicating the large amount of work involved in selecting and processing data sets and model experiments. We have also presented a series of case studies that illustrate the power of DGVMs, even with their known limitations, in explaining a remarkable variety of Earth System phenomena and in addressing contemporary issues related to climate and land-use change. These case studies encourage us to believe that the continued development of DGVMs is a worthwhile enterprise. Finally, new directions in Earth System Science point to a range of aspects in which DGVMs could be improved so as to take account of recently acquired knowledge, such as experimental work on whole-ecosystem responses to environmental modification and new understanding of the functional basis of plant traits; complemented by an effort to represent semi-natural and agricultural ecosystems and the impacts of different management practices on these ecosystems; and extended to include processes such as trace-gas emissions, which are important in order to understand the functional role of the terrestrial biosphere in the Earth System. Together, these potential developments add up to an ambitious research program, requiring the economies of scale that only an international collaborative effort can provide.},

An analytical justification of the use of dimension-reduction by empirical orthogonal functions, in the context of early warning signals, is provided and the one-dimensional techniques are also extended to spatially separated time series over a 2D field. The challenge of predicting an approaching tropical cyclone by a tipping-point analysis of the sea-level pressure series is used as the primary example, and an analytical model of a moving cyclone is also developed in order to test predictions. We show that the one-dimensional power spectrum indicator may be used following dimension-reduction or over a 2D field.

We re-evaluate this rule based on 28 fully stocked pure stands of common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and common oak (Quercus petraea [Mattuschka] Liebl.) in Germany that date back to the year 1870. OLS regression of the model ln(N) = a + b{$\cdot$}ln(d) results in b values of -1.789 for common beech, -1.664 for Norway spruce, -1.593 for Scots pine, and -1.424 for common oak. The allometric coefficient for common beech differs significantly from the other species. There is also a significant difference between the b values of Norway spruce and common oak. Except for Scots pine, the above allometric coefficients deviate significantly (common beech) and close-to-significantly (Norway spruce, common oak) from the coefficient -1.605 postulated by Reineke in 1933. To cover the species-specific oscillation of mortality rates, we additionally calculate the self-thinning coefficient for each survey period. Ecological implications of the species-specific scaling exponents are stressed and consequences regarding tools for regulating stand density are discussed.

Liebl., and pedunculate oak, Q. robur L.) is of considerable importance in Europe and will probably become even more important under climate change. Therefore, the performance of oak and beech in mixture was compared with the species' growth in pure stands. Data from 37 long-term mixing experiments in Poland, Germany and Switzerland were pooled for analysis of mixing effects on stand productivity and possible interrelationships with mixing portions or site conditions. We found that on average, mixed stands of oak and beech exceeded biomass productivity in pure stands by 30 \% or 1. 7 t ha-1 year-1, as the growth of both species was benefitted by the mixture. However, that the interaction actually ranged from facilitation and overyielding on poor sites to underyielding on fertile sites triggered by competition. An empirically derived interaction model showed volume and dry mass growth changing in mixed stands from gains of 50 \% to losses of 10 \% depending on site conditions. It is concluded that the analysed mixture grows in accordance with the stress-gradient hypothesis and that our results suggest a site-specific relationship between species mixture and biomass productivity. As a consequence, an adequate species mix should result in increased productivity under steady state as well as climate change. {\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {While previous studies focused on tree growth in pure stands, we reveal that tree resistance and resilience to drought stress can be modified distinctly through species mixing. Our study is based on tree ring measurement on cores from increment boring of 559 trees of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica [L.]) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) in South Germany, with half sampled in pure, respectively, mixed stands. Indices for resistance, recovery and resilience were applied for quantifying the tree growth reaction on the episodic drought stress in 1976 and 2003. The following general reaction patterns were found. (i) In pure stands, spruce has the lowest resistance, but the quickest recovery; oak and beech were more resistant, but recover was much slower and they are less resilient. (ii) In mixture, spruce and oak perform as in pure stands, but beech was significantly more resistant and resilient than in monoculture. (iii) Especially when mixed with oak, beech is facilitated. We hypothesise that the revealed water stress release of beech emerges in mixture because of the asynchronous stress reaction pattern of beech and oak and a facilitation of beech by hydraulic lift of water by oak. This facilitation of beech in mixture with oak means a contribution to the frequently reported overyield of beech in mixed versus pure stands. We discuss the far-reaching implications that these differences in stress response under intra- and inter-specific environments have for forest ecosystem dynamics and management under climate change. {\copyright} 2012 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.},

Stands still follow similar general allometric rules, but proceed more rapidly through usual trajectories. As forest stands develop faster, tree numbers are currently 17-20\% lower than in past same-aged stands. Self-thinning lines remain constant, while growth rates increase indicating the stock of resources have not changed, while growth velocity and turnover have altered.

Biomass production, canopy structure and light interception were quantified and the effects of coppicing and of planting at wider (1.5 m) spacing were determined. Bowles hybrid willow was grown as coppice planted at 1.0 m spacing and its canopy characteristics compared with those of coppiced alder and poplar. Total above-ground biomass at 5 years old, ranged from 51 to 81 Mg ha-1 dry matter with an average annual production of 10 Mg ha-1 dry matter. Coppicing reduced poplar and alder biomass by 26\% and 47\%, respectively. Planting at the wider spacing reduced stocking density by 56\% and led to a 35\% reduction in biomass. Both coppicing and planting at wider spacing increased root:shoot ratios and leaf weight ratios in alder and poplar and reduced the seasonal interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for 2 years. Light interception was most influenced by early canopy development due to the annual distribution of PAR. Treatment effects on net photosynthesis were due, primarily, to changes in canopy structure affecting light levels. After 3 years light interception was similar across all treatments suggesting that planting at wider spacing or early coppicing would require additional weed control for one more growing season. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Wood products are considered to contribute to the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. A critical gap in the life cycle of wood products is to transfer the raw timber from the forest to the processing wood industry and, thus, the primary wood products. Therefore, often rough estimates are used for this step to obtain total forestry carbon balances. The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the fate of timber harvested in Thuringian state forests (central Germany), representing a large, intensively managed forested region, and (2) to quantify carbon stocks and the lifetime of primary wood products made from this timber. The analyses were based on the amount and assortments of actually sold timber, and production parameters of the companies that bought and processed this timber. In addition, for coniferous stands of a selected Thuringian forest district, we calculated potential effects of management, as expressed by different thinning regimes on wood products and their lifetimes. Total annual timber sale of soft- and hardwoods from Thuringian state forests (195,000 ha) increased from about 136,893 t C ({$\sim$}0.7 t C ha-1 year-1) in 1996 to 280,194 t C ({$\sim$}1.4 t C ha-1 year-1) in 2005. About 47\% of annual total timber harvest went into short-lived wood products with a mean residence time (MRT) {$<$} 25 years. Thirty-one per cent of the total harvest went into wood products with an MRT of 25-43 years, and only 22\% was used as construction wood and glued wood, products with the longest MRT (50 years). The average MRT of carbon in harvested wood products was 20 years. Thinning from above throughout the rotation of spruce forests would lead to an average MRT in harvested wood products of about 23 years, thinning from below of about 18 years. A comparison of our calculations with estimates that resulted from the products module of the CO2FIX model (Nabuurs et al. 2001) demonstrates the influence of regional differences in forest management and wood processing industry on the lifetime of harvested wood products. To our knowledge, the present study provides for the first time real carbon inputs of a defined forest management unit to the wood product sector by linking data on raw timber production, timber sales and wood processing. With this new approach and using this data, it should be possible to substantially improve the net-carbon balance of the entire forestry sector. {\copyright} The Authtor(s) 2009.},

Harmonized inventory data from 16 European countries were used in combination with remote sensing data and a gap-filling algorithm to produce this consistent and comparable forest structure data set across European forests. We showed how land cover data can be used to scale inventory data to a higher resolution which in turn ensures a consistent data structure across sub-regional, country and European forest assessments. Cross validation and comparison with published country statistics of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicate that the chosen methodology is able to produce robust and accurate forest structure data across Europe, even for areas where no inventory data were available.},

  abstract = {Although the existence of a large carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems is well-established, the drivers of this sink remain uncertain. It has been suggested that perturbations to forest demography caused by past land-use change, management, and natural disturbances may be causing a large component of current carbon uptake. Here we use a global compilation of forest age observations, combined with a terrestrial biosphere model with explicit modeling of forest regrowth, to partition the global forest carbon sink between old-growth and regrowth stands over the period 1981--2010. For 2001--2010 we find a carbon sink of 0.85 (0.66--0.96) Pg year -1 located in intact old-growth forest, primarily in the moist tropics and boreal Siberia, and 1.30 (1.03--1.96) Pg year -1 located in stands regrowing after past disturbance. Approaching half of the sink in regrowth stands would have occurred from demographic changes alone, in the absence of other environmental changes. These age-constrained results show consistency with those simulated using an ensemble of demographically-enabled terrestrial biosphere models following an independent reconstruction of historical land use and management. We estimate that forests will accumulate an additional 69 (44--131) Pg C in live biomass from changes in demography alone if natural disturbances, wood harvest, and reforestation continue at rates comparable to those during 1981--2010. Our results confirm that it is not possible to understand the current global terrestrial carbon sink without accounting for the size-able sink due to forest demography. They also imply that a large portion of the current terrestrial carbon sink is strictly transient in nature.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Studies have indicated that plant stomatal conductance (gs) decreases in response to elevated atmospheric CO2, a phenomenon of significance for the global hydrological cycle. However, gs increases across certain CO2 ranges have been predicted by optimization models. The aim of this work was to demonstrate that under certain environmental conditions, gs can increase in response to elevated CO2. Methods Using (1) an extensive, up-to-date synthesis of gs responses in free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments, (2) in situ measurements across four biomes showing dynamic gs responses to a CO2 rise of {$\sim$}50 ppm (characterizing the change in this greenhouse gas over the past three decades) and (3) a photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model, it is demonstrated that gs can in some cases increase in response to increasing atmospheric CO2. Key Results Field observations are corroborated by an extensive synthesis of gs responses in FACE experiments showing that 11.8 \% of gs responses under experimentally elevated CO2 are positive. They are further supported by a strong data-model fit (r2 = 0.607) using a stomatal optimization model applied to the field gs dataset. A parameter space identified in the Farquhar-Ball-Berry photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model confirms field observations of increasing gs under elevated CO2 in hot dry conditions. Contrary to the general assumption, positive gs responses to elevated CO2, although relatively rare, are a feature of woody taxa adapted to warm, low-humidity conditions, and this response is also demonstrated in global simulations using the Community Land Model (CLM4). Conclusions The results contradict the over-simplistic notion that global vegetation always responds with decreasing gs to elevated CO2, a finding that has important implications for predicting future vegetation feedbacks on the hydrological cycle at the regional level.},

  abstract = {Surface albedo is one of the key controlling geophysical parameters in the surface energy budget studies, and its temporal and spatial variation is closely related to the global climate change and regional weather system due to the albedo feedback mechanism. As an efficient tool for monitoring the surfaces of the Earth, remote sensing is widely used for deriving long-term surface broadband albedo with various geostationary and polar-orbit satellite platforms in recent decades. Moreover, the algorithms for estimating surface broadband albedo from satellite observations, including narrow-to-broadband conversions, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) angular modeling, direct-estimation algorithm and the algorithms for estimating albedo from geostationary satellite data, are developed and improved. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature review on algorithms and products for mapping surface broadband albedo with satellite observations and provide a discussion of different algorithms and products in a historical perspective based on citation analysis of the published literature. This paper shows that the observation technologies and accuracy requirement of applications are important, and long-term, global fully-covered (including land, ocean, and sea-ice surfaces), gap-free, surface broadband albedo products with higher spatial and temporal resolution are required for climate change, surface energy budget, and hydrological studies.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere - the "global carbon budget" - is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land use and land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {\textpm}1{$\sigma$}. For the last decade available (2008-2017), EFF was 9.4{\textpm}0.5 GtC yr{\^g}'1, ELUC 1.5{\textpm}0.7 GtC yr{\^g}'1, GATM 4.7{\textpm}0.02 GtC yr{\^g}'1, SOCEAN 2.4{\textpm}0.5 GtC yr{\^g}'1, and SLAND 3.2{\textpm}0.8 GtC yr{\^g}'1, with a budget imbalance BIM of 0.5 GtC yr{\^g}'1 indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For the year 2017 alone, the growth in EFF was about 1.6 \% and emissions increased to 9.9{\textpm}0.5 GtC yr{\^g}'1. Also for 2017, ELUC was 1.4{\textpm}0.7 GtC yr{\^g}'1, GATM was 4.6{\textpm}0.2 GtC yr{\^g}'1, SOCEAN was 2.5{\textpm}0.5 GtC yr{\^g}'1, and SLAND was 3.8{\textpm}0.8 GtC yr{\^g}'1, with a BIM of 0.3 GtC. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 405.0{\textpm}0.1 ppm averaged over 2017. For 2018, preliminary data for the first 6-9 months indicate a renewed growth in EFF of +2.7 \% (range of 1.8 \% to 3.7 \%) based on national emission projections for China, the US, the EU, and India and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. The analysis presented here shows that the mean and trend in the five components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period of 1959-2017, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr{\^g}'1 persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. A detailed comparison among individual estimates and the introduction of a broad range of observations show (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land-use change emissions, (2) a persistent low agreement among the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent underestimation of the CO2 variability by ocean models, originating outside the tropics. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Qu{\'e}r{\'e} et al., 2018, 2016, 2015a, b, 2014, 2013).},

  abstract = {Abstract. The important role of fire in regulating vegetation community composition and contributions to emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols make it a critical component of dynamic global vegetation models and Earth system models. Over 2 decades of development, a wide variety of model structures and mechanisms have been designed and incorporated into global fire models, which have been linked to different vegetation models. However, there has not yet been a systematic examination of how these different strategies contribute to model performance. Here we describe the structure of the first phase of the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP), which for the first time seeks to systematically compare a number of models. By combining a standardized set of input data and model experiments with a rigorous comparison of model outputs to each other and to observations, we will improve the understanding of what drives vegetation fire, how it can best be simulated, and what new or improved observational data could allow better constraints on model behavior. In this paper, we introduce the fire models used in the first phase of FireMIP, the simulation protocols applied, and the benchmarking system used to evaluate the models. We have also created supplementary tables that describe, in thorough mathematical detail, the structure of each model.},

  abstract = {Key message: Multi-objective robust decision making is a promising decision-making method in forest management under climate change as it adequately considers deep uncertainties and handles the long-term, inflexible, and multi-objective character of decisions. This paper provides guidance for application and recommendation on the design. Context: Recent studies have promoted the application of robust decision-making approaches to adequately consider deep uncertainties in natural resource management. Yet, applications have until now hardly addressed the forest management context. Aims: This paper seeks to (i) assemble different definitions of uncertainty and draw recommendation to deal with the different levels in decision making, (ii) outline those applications that adequately deal with deep uncertainty, and (iii) systematically review the applications to natural resources management in order to (iv) propose adoption in forest management. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of robust decision-making approaches and their applications in natural resource management. Different levels of uncertainty were categorized depending on available knowledge in order to provide recommendations on dealing with deep uncertainty. Robust decision-making approaches and their applications to natural resources management were evaluated based on different analysis steps. A simplified application to a hypothetical tree species selection problem illustrates that distinct robustness formulations may lead to different conclusions. Finally, robust decision-making applications to forest management under climate change uncertainty were evaluated and recommendations drawn. Results: Deep uncertainty is not adequately considered in the forest management literature. Yet, the comparison of robust decision-making approaches and their applications to natural resource management provide guidance on applying robust decision making in forest management regarding decision contexts, decision variables, robustness metrics, and how uncertainty is depicted. Conclusion: As forest management is characterized by long decision horizons, inflexible systems, and multiple objectives, and is subject to deeply uncertain climate change, the application of a robust decision-making framework using a global, so-called satisficing robustness metric is recommended. Further recommendations are distinguished depending on the decision context.},

To asses this, we used an innovative method along with space-based observations to determine the timing of greening and dormancy and then to determine existing trends of them and causes. Early greening still occurs, albeit at slower rates than before. However, a recent (2011--2020) shift in the timing of dormancy has caused the season length to decrease back to 1980s levels. This shortening of season length is attributed primarily to higher atmospheric water demand in summer that suppresses transpiration even for soil moisture levels as of previous years. Transpiration suppression implies that vegetation is unable to meet the high transpiration needs. Our results have implications for future management of European ecosystems (e.g., net carbon balance and water and energy exchange with atmosphere) in a warmer world.},

The soil moisture dynamics given by the change in soil moisture between two time periods can provide information on the intensification or improvement of drought conditions.

The change in soil moisture estimated from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite observations was compared with the United States Drought Monitor (USDM) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The results indicated that the soil moisture change over 13-week and 26-week intervals is able to capture the changes in drought intensity levels in the USDM, and the change over a four-week interval correlated well with the one-month SPI values. This suggested that a short-term negative soil moisture change may indicate a lack of precipitation, whereas a persistent long-term negative soil moisture change may indicate severe drought conditions. The results further indicate that the inclusion of soil moisture change will add more value to the existing drought-monitoring products.},

Contemporary construction of tall buildings from timber, in whole or in part, suggests a growing interest in the potential for building with wood at a scale not previously attainable. As wood is the only significant building material that is grown, we have a natural inclination that building in wood is good for the environment. But under what conditions is this really the case? The environmental benefits of using timber are not straightforward; although it is a natural product, a large amount of energy is used to dry and process it. Much of this can come from the biomass of the tree itself, but that requires investment in plant, which is not always possible in an industry that is widely distributed among many small producers. And what should we build with wood? Are skyscrapers in timber a good use of this natural resource, or are there other aspects of civil and structural engineering, or large-scale infrastructure, that would be a better use of wood? Here, we consider a holistic picture ranging in scale from the science of the cell wall to the engineering and global policies that could maximise forestry and timber construction as a boon to both people and the planet.},

  abstract = {Climate extremes can trigger exceptional responses in terrestrial ecosystems, for instance by altering growth or mortality rates. Such effects are often manifested in reductions in net primary productivity (NPP). Investigating a Europe-wide network of annual radial tree growth records confirms this pattern: we find that 28\% of tree ring width (TRW) indices are below two standard deviations in years in which extremely low precipitation, high temperatures or the combination of both noticeably affect tree growth. Based on these findings, we investigate possibilities for detecting climate-driven patterns in long-term TRW data to evaluate state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation models such as the Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model for managed land (LPJmL). The major problem in this context is that LPJmL simulates NPP but not explicitly the radial tree growth, and we need to develop a generic method to allow for a comparison between simulated and observed response patterns. We propose an analysis scheme that quantifies the coincidence rate of climate extremes with some biotic responses (here TRW or simulated NPP). We find a relative reduction of 34\% in simulated NPP during precipitation, temperature and combined extremes. This reduction is comparable to the TRW response patterns, but the model responds much more sensitively to drought stress. We identify 10 extreme years during the 20th century during which both model and measurements indicate high coincidence rates across Europe. However, we detect substantial regional differences in simulated and observed responses to climatic extreme events. One explanation for this discrepancy could be the tendency of tree ring data to originate from climatically stressed sites. The difference between model and observed data is amplified by the fact that dynamic vegetation models are designed to simulate mean ecosystem responses on landscape or regional scales. We find that both simulation results and measurements display carry-over effects from climate anomalies during the previous year. We conclude that radial tree growth chronologies provide a suitable basis for generic model benchmarks. The broad application of coincidence analysis in generic model benchmarks along with an increased availability of representative long-term measurements and improved process-based models will refine projections of the long-term carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, the warming in the Arctic has been much faster than in the rest of the world, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. Numerous studies report that the Arctic is warming either twice, more than twice, or even three times as fast as the globe on average. Here we show, by using several observational datasets which cover the Arctic region, that during the last 43 years the Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe, which is a higher ratio than generally reported in literature. We compared the observed Arctic amplification ratio with the ratio simulated by state-of-the-art climate models, and found that the observed four-fold warming ratio over 1979--2021 is an extremely rare occasion in the climate model simulations. The observed and simulated amplification ratios are more consistent with each other if calculated over a longer period; however the comparison is obscured by observational uncertainties before 1979. Our results indicate that the recent four-fold Arctic warming ratio is either an extremely unlikely event, or the climate models systematically tend to underestimate the amplification.},

  abstract = {(Table presented.). Summary: We compare carbon (and hence energy) costs of the different modes of phosphorus (P) acquisition by vascular land plants. Phosphorus-acquisition modes are considered to be mechanisms of plants together with their root symbionts and structures such as cluster roots involved in mobilising or absorbing P. Phosphorus sources considered are soluble and insoluble inorganic and organic pools. Costs include operating the P-acquisition mechanisms, and resource requirements to construct and maintain them. For most modes, costs increase as the relevant soil P concentration declines. Costs can thus be divided into a component incurred irrespective of soil P concentration, and a component describing how quickly costs increase as the soil P concentration declines. Differences in sensitivity of costs to soil P concentration arise mainly from how economically mycorrhizal fungal hyphae or roots that explore the soil volume are constructed, and from costs of exudates that hydrolyse or mobilise insoluble P forms. In general, modes of acquisition requiring least carbon at high soil P concentrations experience a steeper increase in costs as soil P concentrations decline. The relationships between costs and concentrations suggest some reasons why different modes coexist, and why the mixture of acquisition modes differs between sites.},

Future increases in nitrogen deposition have been predicted to increase the size of these terrestrial and marine carbon sinks, but although higher rates of nitrogen deposition might enhance carbon uptake in northern and tropical forests, they will probably have less of an impact on ocean sink strength. Combined, the land and ocean sinks may sequester an additional 10\% of anthropogenic cabon emissions by 2030 owing to increased nitrogen inputs, but a more conservative estimate of 1 to 2\% is more likely. Thus nitrogen-induced increases in the strength of land and ocean sinks are unlikely to keep pace with future increases in carbon dioxide. {\copyright} 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop an advanced parameterization of the snow-free land surface albedo for climate modelling describing the temporal variation of surface albedo as a function of vegetation phenology on a monthly time scale. To estimate the effect of vegetation phenology on snow-free land surface albedo, remotely sensed data products from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the NASA Terra platform measured during 2001 to 2004 are used. The snow-free surface albedo variability is determined by the optical contrast between the vegetation canopy and the underlying soil surface. The MODIS products of the white-sky albedo for total shortwave broad bands and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) are analysed to separate the vegetation canopy albedo from the underlying soil albedo. Global maps of pure soil albedo and pure vegetation albedo are derived on a 0.5{$^\circ$} regular latitude/longitude grid, re-sampling the high-resolution information from remote sensing-measured pixel level to the model grid scale and filling up gaps from the satellite data. These global maps show that in the northern and mid-latitudes soils are mostly darker than vegetation, whereas in the lower latitudes, especially in semi-deserts, soil albedo is mostly higher than vegetation albedo. The separated soil and vegetation albedo can be applied to compute the annual surface albedo cycle from monthly varying leaf area index. This parameterization is especially designed for the land surface scheme of the regional climate model REMO and the global climate model ECHAM5, but can easily be integrated into the land surface schemes of other regional and global climate models. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2008.},

Particularly unsettling is that many analyses and well-intended actions are implemented in fogs of ambiguity surrounding definitions of the term `forest'---a problem that is not solely semantic; with development of markets for biomass carbon, vegetation classification exercises take on new relevance. For example, according to the basic implementation guidelines of the Kyoto Protocol, closed canopy natural forest could be replaced by monoclonal plantations of genetically engineered exotic tree species and no deforestation would have occurred. Following these same guidelines, carbon credits for afforestation could be available for planting trees in species-rich savannas; these new plantations would count towards a country moving towards the `forest transition,' the point at which there is no net `forest' loss. Such obvious conflicts between biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration might be avoided if `forest' was clearly defined and if other vegetation types and other ecosystem values were explicitly recognized. While acknowledging that no one approach to vegetation classification is likely to satisfy all users at all scales, we present an approach that recognizes the importance of species composition, reflects the utility of land-cover characteristics that are identifiable via remote sensing, and acknowledges that many sorts of forest degradation do not reduce carbon stocks ( e.g ., defaunation) or canopy cover ( e.g ., over-harvesting of understory nontimber forest products).},

It is, however, susceptible to drought and there is concern that anticipated climate change may greatly influence its yield potential. In addition to the climate, soil characteristics are known to play a major role in tree growth rates. Detailed knowledge about the relationships between the soil and tree growth in the face of climate change has started to be generated only recently. As a contribution to this field we investigated the influence of soil on the drought susceptibility of Norway spruce by means of dendrochronology. Tree-ring data were acquired from two sites southwest of Munich, Germany, with rather similar climates but different soil textures. By combining multivariate statistics with climate correlation and pointer year analyses, we were able to show a clear differentiation between the two sites with respect to the growth performance of Norway spruce. That is, trees growing on a shallow, well-drained soil grew less and expressed a relatively higher drought sensitivity compared to trees from a site with a deep, silty soil as indicated by higher correlations with drought related indices and more intense droughts in negative pointer years compared to neutral years. Among the considered drought indices the soil water deficit index explained best the multivariate differentiation between the two sites, wherefore we interpret these findings as a significant impact of soil characteristics on Norway spruce performance. In the context of climate change and an increasing risk of extreme droughts during the 21st century, this finding has important implications for forest management activities since the risk of drought induced tree mortality appears to be affected by soil conditions.},

  abstract = {Plants growing in low phosphorus (P) soils, such as in the predominant soils of Amazonia, are believed to devote more energy to acquiring P through absorptive root production, symbionts, and root exudates than plants in more fertile soils. Accounting for these energy costs in vegetation models is essential, as underestimating carbon (C) allocation to nutrient acquisition may lead to overestimating plant biomass growth. We developed a quantitative model to test a theoretical framework of C costs of P acquisition across soil P gradients. The model considers four strategies: P foraging via absorptive roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and P mining via root exudation of phosphatases and organic acids. We used field observations (i.e., soil data, plant biomass production, and stoichiometry of different organs) from ten sites across Amazonia to calibrate the model and explore different scenarios of (i) experimental soil P addition and (ii) elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO2). Our model reproduced expected trends in P-acquisition strategies, with plants increasingly investing in foraging strategies as soil soluble inorganic P (Pi) increases and increasingly investing in mining strategies as total P and less available P forms decrease. Relative investment in P acquisition was within observed ranges. Plants, on average and across all sites, invested the equivalent of 20.5\% of their estimated total net primary production (NPP) in P acquisition. On average, plants allocated 15.3\% of their NPP to P acquisition in the three most fertile sites, compared to 29.0\% in the least fertile sites. C allocation to arbuscular mycorrhizas, phosphatases, and organic acids, which are not commonly measured components of total NPP, was up to 25.8\% (16.9\% on average) of the total NPP. We highlight the need for quantitative data on plant C allocation to P acquisition from the soil to strengthen further model development and future model projections.},

  abstract = {As countries advance in greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting for climate change mitigation, consistent estimates of aboveground net biomass change (∆AGB) are needed. Countries with limited forest monitoring capabilities in the tropics and subtropics rely on IPCC 2006 default ∆AGB rates, which are values per ecological zone, per continent. Similarly, research into forest biomass change at a large scale also makes use of these rates. IPCC 2006 default rates come from a handful of studies, provide no uncertainty indications and do not distinguish between older secondary forests and old-growth forests. As part of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, we incorporate ∆AGB data available from 2006 onwards, comprising 176 chronosequences in secondary forests and 536 permanent plots in old-growth and managed/logged forests located in 42 countries in Africa, North and South America and Asia. We generated ∆AGB rate estimates for younger secondary forests ({$\leq$}20~years), older secondary forests ('20~years and up to 100~years) and old-growth forests, and accounted for uncertainties in our estimates. In tropical rainforests, for which data availability was the highest, our ∆AGB rate estimates ranged from 3.4 (Asia) to 7.6 (Africa) Mg~ha-1~year-1 in younger secondary forests, from 2.3 (North and South America) to 3.5 (Africa) Mg~ha-1~year-1 in older secondary forests, and 0.7 (Asia) to 1.3 (Africa) Mg~ha-1~year-1 in old-growth forests. We provide a rigorous and traceable refinement of the IPCC 2006 default rates in tropical and subtropical ecological zones, and identify which areas require more research on ∆AGB. In this respect, this study should be considered as an important step towards quantifying the role of tropical and subtropical forests as carbon sinks with higher accuracy; our new rates can be used for large-scale GHG accounting by governmental bodies, nongovernmental organizations and in scientific research.},

  abstract = {{$\bullet$} Context: Projecting changes in forest productivity in Europe is crucial for adapting forest management to changing environmental conditions. {$\bullet$} Aims: The objective of this paper is to project forest productivity changes under different climate change scenarios at a large number of sites in Europe with a stand-scale process-based model. {$\bullet$} Methods: We applied the process-based forest growth model 4C at 132 typical forest sites of important European tree species in ten environmental zones using climate change scenarios from three different climate models and two different assumptions about CO 2 effects on productivity. {$\bullet$} Results: This paper shows that future forest productivity will be affected by climate change and that these effects depend strongly on the climate scenario used and the persistence of CO2 effects. We find that productivity increases in Northern Europe, increases or decreases in Central Europe, and decreases in Southern Europe. This geographical pattern is mirrored by the responses of the individual tree species. The productivity of Scots pine and Norway spruce, mostly located in central and northern Europe, increases while the productivity of Common beech and oak in southern regions decreases. It is important to note that we consider the physiological response to climate change excluding disturbances or management. {$\bullet$} Conclusions: Different climate change scenarios and assumptions about the persistence of CO2 effects lead to uncertain projections of future forest productivity. These uncertainties need to be integrated into forest management planning and adaptation of forest management to climate change using adaptive management frameworks. {\copyright} 2013 INRA and Springer-Verlag France.},

  abstract = {Recent studies projecting future climate change impacts on forests mainly consider either the effects of climate change on productivity or on disturbances. However, productivity and disturbances are intrinsically linked because 1) disturbances directly affect forest productivity (e.g. via a reduction in leaf area, growing stock or resource-use efficiency), and 2) disturbance susceptibility is often coupled to a certain development phase of the forest with productivity determining the time a forest is in this specific phase of susceptibility. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of forest productivity changes in different forest regions in Europe under climate change, and partition these changes into effects induced by climate change alone and by climate change and disturbances. We present projections of climate change impacts on forest productivity from state-of-The-Art forest models that dynamically simulate forest productivity and the effects of the main European disturbance agents (fire, storm, insects), driven by the same climate scenario in seven forest case studies along a large climatic gradient throughout Europe. Our study shows that, in most cases, including disturbances in the simulations exaggerate ongoing productivity declines or cancel out productivity gains in response to climate change. In fewer cases, disturbances also increase productivity or buffer climate-change induced productivity losses, e.g. because low severity fires can alleviate resource competition and increase fertilization. Even though our results cannot simply be extrapolated to other types of forests and disturbances, we argue that it is necessary to interpret climate change-induced productivity and disturbance changes jointly to capture the full range of climate change impacts on forests and to plan adaptation measures.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios that form the analytical backbone for other contributions to this Special Issue. We first describe the motivation behind this scenario exercise and introduce the main scenario features and characteristics, in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Altogether, we analyze three 'baseline' scenarios of different socio-economic and technological developments that are assumed not to include any explicit climate policies. We then impose a range of climate stabilization targets on these baseline scenarios and analyze in detail the feasibility, costs and uncertainties of meeting a range of different climate stabilization targets in accordance with Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The scenarios were developed by the IIASA Integrated Assessment Modeling Framework that encompasses detailed representations of the principal GHG-emitting sectors-energy, industry, agriculture, and forestry. The main analytical findings from our analysis focus on the implications of salient uncertainties (associated with scenario baselines and stabilization targets), on feasibility and costs of climate stabilization efforts, and on the choice of appropriate portfolios of emissions abatement measures. We further analyze individual technological options with regards to their aggregated cumulative contribution toward emissions mitigation during the 21st century as well as their deployment over time. Our results illustrate that the energy sector will remain by far the largest source of GHG emissions and hence remain the prime target of emissions reduction. Ultimately, this may lead to a complete restructuring of the global energy system. Climate mitigation could also significantly change the relative economics of traditional versus new, more climate friendly products and services. This is especially the case within the energy system, which accounts for the largest share of emissions reductions, but it is also the case in the agriculture and forestry sectors, where emissions reduction and sink enhancement measures are relatively more modest. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The RCP8.5 combines assumptions about high population and relatively slow income growth with modest rates of technological change and energy intensity improvements, leading in the long term to high energy demand and GHG emissions in absence of climate change policies. Compared to the total set of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP8.5 thus corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Using the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework and the MESSAGE model for the development of the RCP8.5, we focus in this paper on two important extensions compared to earlier scenarios: 1) the development of spatially explicit air pollution projections, and 2) enhancements in the land-use and land-cover change projections. In addition, we explore scenario variants that use RCP8.5 as a baseline, and assume different degrees of greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce radiative forcing. Based on our modeling framework, we find it technically possible to limit forcing from RCP8.5 to lower levels comparable to the other RCPs (2.6 to 6 W/m2). Our scenario analysis further indicates that climate policy-induced changes of global energy supply and demand may lead to significant co-benefits for other policy priorities, such as local air pollution. {\copyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400--1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 {$^\circ$}C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

However, the global impact of management (for example, harvesting) on the carbon budget of forests remains poorly quantified. We integrated global maps of forest biomass and management with machine learning to show that by removing human intervention, under current climatic conditions and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration, existing global forests could increase their aboveground biomass by up to 44.1 (error range: 21.0 to 63.0) petagrams of carbon. This is an increase of 15 to 16\% over current levels, equating to about 4 years of current anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Therefore, without strong reductions in emissions, this strategy holds low mitigation potential, and the forest sink should be preserved to offset residual carbon emissions rather than to compensate for present emissions levels.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {The ELECTRE III outranking model is particularly suited to aiding the choice between project alternatives on the basis of mainly environmental criteria. The model requires values of three criterion thresholds, the indifference threshold (q), the preference threshold (p) and the veto threshold (v). These allow the uncertainties inherent in the criteria valuations to be incorporated into the decision process. There is, at present, a high degree of subjectivity involved in determining these thresholds, which are expressed in terms of the error/uncertainty associated with the valuations of each of the criteria under scrutiny. If, however, the ELECTRE III outranking model is to be used within a formal environmental appraisal system, the thresholds which govern the outranking relationship of one project option over another must take account of the effect on human beings of the difference between any two criterion scores. The authors suggest a new method for applying the standard ELECTRE III model to decision-aid problems within the formal mechanism of environmental impact assessment. This involves a new, more comprehensive approach for specifying realistic limits for p, q and v, within the context of an environmental appraisal, where both criterion error/uncertainty and human sensitivity to differing levels of the criterion are taken into account. Threshold valuations for noise impacts from a highway project are used to illustrate the proposed method. {\copyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Earth System Models (ESMs) aim to project global change. Central to this aim is the need to accurately model global carbon fluxes. Photosynthetic carbon dioxide assimilation by the terrestrial biosphere is the largest of these fluxes, and in many ESMs is represented by the Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry (FvCB) model of photosynthesis. The maximum rate of carboxylation by the enzyme Rubisco, commonly termed V c,max, is a key parameter in the FvCB model. This study investigated the derivation of the values of V c,max used to represent different plant functional types (PFTs) in ESMs. Four methods for estimating V c,max were identified; (1) an empirical or (2) mechanistic relationship was used to relate V c,max to leaf N content, (3) V c,max was estimated using an approach based on the optimization of photosynthesis and respiration or (4) calibration of a user-defined V c,max to obtain a target model output. Despite representing the same PFTs, the land model components of ESMs were parameterized with a wide range of values for V c,max (-46 to +77 \% of the PFT mean). In many cases, parameterization was based on limited data sets and poorly defined coefficients that were used to adjust model parameters and set PFT-specific values for V c,max. Examination of the models that linked leaf N mechanistically to V c,max identified potential changes to fixed parameters that collectively would decrease V c,max by 31 \% in C3 plants and 11 \% in C4 plants. Plant trait data bases are now available that offer an excellent opportunity for models to update PFT-specific parameters used to estimate V c,max. However, data for parameterizing some PFTs, particularly those in the Tropics and the Arctic are either highly variable or largely absent. {\copyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).},

  abstract = {Forests are home to many species and provide biomass for material and energy. Here, we modeled the potential global species extinction risk from future scenarios of climate mitigation and EU28 forest management. We considered the continuation of current practices, the adoption of closer-to-nature management (low-intensity practices), and set-asides (conversion to unharvested forestland) on portions of EU28 forestland under two climate mitigation pathways as well as the consequences for the wood trade. Expanding set-aside to more than 25\% of EU28 currently managed forestland by 2100 increased the global extinction risk compared to the continuation of current practices. This outcome stems from a projected increase in EU forest biomass imports, partially from biodiversity-vulnerable regions to compensate for a decrease in domestic harvest. Conversely, closer-to-nature management on up to 37.5\% of EU28 forestland lowered extinction risks. Increasing the internal production and partially sourcing imported biomass from low-intensity managed areas lowered the species extinction footprint even further. However, low-intensity practices could not entirely compensate for the increased extinction risk under a high climate mitigation scenario with greater demand for lignocellulosic crops and energywood. When developing climate mitigation strategies, it is crucial to assess forest biomass supply chains for the early detection of extinction risks in non-EU regions and for developing strategies to prevent increase of global impacts.},

  abstract = {Land use and land cover changes greatly influence surface energy balance and consequently climate, and are likely to be associated with the persistent predictions of warming and drying throughout the Mediterranean and other regions. We specifically address the question of how the high radiation load and suppressed latent heat flux, intrinsic to dry regions, interact with land use changes and climate in these environments. We use for this purpose a detailed 6-year (2003-2008) study of the redistribution of the radiation load in an open-canopy pine forest. The results show that compared with the background shrubland, there was a 23.8Wm-2 increase in shortwave radiation load on the forest (to a mean annual net solar radiation of 211Wm-2) associated with a decrease in albedo of 0.1. Surface (skin) temperature in the forest was lower than in the shrubland (by {\textasciitilde}5{$^\circ$}C on average) due to an efficient 'convector effect' and the production of a large sensible heat flux (up to 926Wm-2 in summer), which effectively shifted heat from the canopy to the overlying boundary layer. The cooler forest skin temperature resulted in suppression of upwelling longwave radiation (by 25Wm-2, annual average), further increasing the forest radiation load (mean annual net radiation of 116 and 67Wm-2 for forest and shrubland, respectively). This suppression also resulted in a local 'canopy greenhouse effect', where upwelling longwave radiation from the ground to the canopy was larger than from the canopy to the atmosphere (by up to 150Wm-2 in summer) and was associated with {\textasciitilde}3{$^\circ$}C warming below the canopy. The ability of the dry productive forest to deal with the high radiation load indicates the potential for afforestation in dry areas. {\copyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Key limitations of simple models arise at very small scales, and in predicting specific future BES values; (3) training local experts in the approaches and tools is important for building local capacity, ownership, trust, and long-term success; (4) decision makers and stakeholders prefer to use a variety of BES value metrics, not only monetary values; (5) an important science gap exists in linking changes in BES to changes in livelihoods, health, cultural values, and other metrics of human wellbeing; and (6) communicating uncertainty in useful and transparent ways remains challenging.},

  abstract = {Regional climate modeling is a dynamical downscaling technique applied to the results of global climate models (GCMs) in order to acquire more information on climate simulations and climate change projections. GCMs and regional climate models (RCMs) have undergone considerable development over the past few decades, and both have increased in resolution. The higher-resolution edge of RCMs compared to GCMs still remains, however. This has been demonstrated in a number of specific studies. As GCMs operate on relatively coarse resolutions, they do not resolve more variable land forms and similar features that shape regional-scale climates. RCMs operate on higher resolutions than GCMs, by a factor of 2-10. Some RCMs now explore resolutions down to 1-5 km. This adds value in regions with variable orography, land-sea and other contrasts, as well as in capturing sharp, short-duration and extreme events. In contrast, large-scale and time-averaged fields, not least over smooth terrain and on scales that have been already skillfully resolved in GCMs, are not much affected. RCMs also generate additional detail compared to GCMs when in climate projection mode. Compared to the present-day climate for which observations exist, here the added value aspect is more complex to evaluate. Nevertheless, added value is meaningfully underlined when there is a clear physical context for it to appear in. In addition to climate modeling and model evaluation-related added value considerations, a significant relevant aspect of added value is the provision of regional scale information, including climate change projections, for climate impact, adaptation, and vulnerability research.},

The effects of the treatments of the dominating tree species European aspen (Populus tremula L.) and birch (Betula pendula Roth and B. pubescens Ehrh.) were studied. During three growing seasons after performed treatment, the proportion of sprouting stools and root shooting of European aspen were reduced in SCR. Birch stools had fewer sprouts stool-1, and sprouts of both birch and European aspen tended to be shorter in SCR. There was a tendency that the sprout mortality was lower in SCR for both birch and European aspen. Residual stands of SCR consisted of proportionally less birch, and more rowan, bird cherry, oak and other species. Coppicing with single tree selection from above suppressed light demanding tree species and promoted the more shade-tolerant species compared to traditional coppicing.

  abstract = {Aim: Primary forests have high conservation value but are rare in Europe due to historic land use. Yet many primary forest patches remain unmapped, and it is unclear to what extent they are effectively protected. Our aim was to (1) compile the most comprehensive European-scale map of currently known primary forests, (2) analyse the spatial determinants characterizing their location and (3) locate areas where so far unmapped primary forests likely occur. Location: Europe. Methods: We aggregated data from a literature review, online questionnaires and 32 datasets of primary forests. We used boosted regression trees to explore which biophysical, socio-economic and forest-related variables explain the current distribution of primary forests. Finally, we predicted and mapped the relative likelihood of primary forest occurrence at a 1-km resolution across Europe. Results: Data on primary forests were frequently incomplete or inconsistent among countries. Known primary forests covered 1.4 Mha in 32 countries (0.7\% of Europe's forest area). Most of these forests were protected (89\%), but only 46\% of them strictly. Primary forests mostly occurred in mountain and boreal areas and were unevenly distributed across countries, biogeographical regions and forest types. Unmapped primary forests likely occur in the least accessible and populated areas, where forests cover a greater share of land, but wood demand historically has been low. Main conclusions: Despite their outstanding conservation value, primary forests are rare and their current distribution is the result of centuries of land use and forest management. The conservation outlook for primary forests is uncertain as many are not strictly protected and most are small and fragmented, making them prone to extinction debt and human disturbance. Predicting where unmapped primary forests likely occur could guide conservation efforts, especially in Eastern Europe where large areas of primary forest still exist but are being lost at an alarming pace.},

  abstract = {Water scarcity is a critical limitation for agricultural systems. Two different water management strategies have evolved in plants: an isohydric strategy and an anisohydric strategy. Isohydric plants maintain a constant midday leaf water potential ({$\Psi$}leaf) when water is abundant, as well as under drought conditions, by reducing stomatal conductance as necessary to limit transpiration. Anisohydric plants have more variable {$\Psi$}leaf and keep their stomata open and photosynthetic rates high for longer periods, even in the presence of decreasing leaf water potential. This risk-taking behavior of anisohydric plants might be beneficial when water is abundant, as well as under moderately stressful conditions. However, under conditions of intense drought, this behavior might endanger the plant. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these two water-usage strategies and their effects on the plant's ability to tolerate abiotic and biotic stress. The involvement of plant tonoplast AQPs in this process will also be discussed.},

  abstract = {Because of human action, the Earth has entered an era where profound changes in the global environment are creating novel conditions that will be discernable far into the future. One consequence may be a large reduction of the Earth's biodiversity, potentially representing a sixth mass extinction. With effective stewardship, the global change drivers that threaten the Earth's biota could be alleviated, but this requires clear understanding of the drivers, their interactions, and how they impact ecological communities. This review identifies 10 anthropogenic global change drivers and discusses how six of the drivers (atmospheric CO2 enrichment, climate change, land transformation, species exploitation, exotic species invasions, eutrophication) impact Earth's biodiversity. Driver impacts on a particular species could be positive or negative. In either case, they initiate secondary responses that cascade along ecological lines of connection and in doing so magnify the initial impact. The unique nature of the threat to the Earth's biodiversity is not simply due to the magnitude of each driver, but due to the speed of change, the novelty of the drivers, and their interactions. Emphasizing one driver, notably climate change, is problematic because the other global change drivers also degrade biodiversity and together threaten the stability of the biosphere. As the main academic journal addressing global change effects on living systems, GCB is well positioned to provide leadership in solving the global change challenge. If humanity cannot meet the challenge, then GCB is positioned to serve as a leading chronicle of the sixth mass extinction to occur on planet Earth.},

We include in our analysis studies on photovoltaic (PV) systems in urban settings -- on buildings, as shade structures, or as stand-alone arrays within an urban environment. We further limit the review to studies that investigate how the urban setting affects the performance of PV systems or how PV systems affect their surrounding urban environment. Our review is based on a systematic search of the literature, which revealed 116 unique articles that addressed the underlying questions in a meaningful way. While there are conflicting results reported across this body of literature, our review and synthesis reveal two key findings: (1) PV can significantly warm the city during the day, provide some cooling at night, and potentially increase energy use for air conditioning of buildings in some climates and building types; and (2) placing PV in an urban setting can adversely affect PV efficiency, reducing overall power production up to 20\% in comparison to PV applications in rural settings. It is recommended that future developments of PV technologies focus both on increased efficiency and the need to increase reflection of wavelengths of energy not converted to electricity by the PV cells. Furthermore, designs for urban PV systems should explicitly consider the effects of elevated urban temperatures, pollution, and shading on system performance.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the energy and carbon balance of two residential house alternatives; a typical wood frame home using more conventional materials (brick cladding, vinyl windows, asphalt shingles, and fibreglass insulation) and a similar wood frame house that also maximizes wood use throughout (cedar shingles and siding, wood windows, and cellulose insulation) in place of the more typical materials used - a wood-intensive house. Carbon emission and fossil fuel consumption balances were established for the two homes based on the cumulative total of three subsystems: (1) forest harvesting and regeneration; (2) cradle-to-gate product manufacturing, construction, and replacement effects over a 100-year service life; and (3) end-of-life effects - landfilling with methane capture and combustion or recovery of biomass for energy production. The net carbon balance of the wood-intensive house showed a complete offset of the manufacturing emissions by the credit given to the system for forest re-growth. Including landfill methane emissions, the wood-intensive life cycle yielded 20 tons of CO2e emissions compared to 72 tons for the typical house. The wood-intensive home's life cycle also consumed only 45\% of the fossil fuels used in the typical house. Diverting wood materials from the landfill at the end of life improved the life cycle balances of both the typical and wood-intensive houses. The carbon balance of the wood-intensive house was 5.2 tons of CO2e permanently removed from the atmosphere (a net carbon sink) as compared to 63.4 of total CO2e emissions for the typical house. Substitution of wood fuel for natural gas and coal in electricity production led to a net energy balance of the wood-intensive house that was nearly neutral, 87.1 GJ energy use, 88\% lower than the scenario in which the materials were landfilled. Allocating biomass generation and carbon sequestration in the forest on an economic basis as opposed to a mass basis significantly improves the life cycle balances of both houses. Employing an economic allocation method to the forest leads to 3-5 times greater carbon sequestration and fossil fuel substitution attributable to the house, which is doubled in forestry regimes that remove stumps and slash as fuel. Thus, wood use has the potential to create a significantly negative carbon footprint for a house up to the point of occupancy and even offset a portion of heating and cooling energy use and carbon emissions; the wood-intensive house is energy and carbon neutral for 34-68 years in Ottawa and has the potential to be a net carbon sink and energy producer in a more temperate climate like San Francisco. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Abstract. The terrestrial forest carbon pool is poorly quantified, in particular in regions with low forest inventory capacity. By combining multiple satellite observations of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter around the year 2010, we generated a global, spatially explicit dataset of above-ground live biomass (AGB; dry mass) stored in forests with a spatial resolution of 1 ha. Using an extensive database of 110 897 AGB measurements from field inventory plots, we show that the spatial patterns and magnitude of AGB are well captured in our map with the exception of regional uncertainties in high-carbon-stock forests with AGB {$>$}250 Mg ha-1, where the retrieval was effectively based on a single radar observation. With a total global AGB of 522 Pg, our estimate of the terrestrial biomass pool in forests is lower than most estimates published in the literature (426--571 Pg). Nonetheless, our dataset increases knowledge on the spatial distribution of AGB compared to the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and highlights the impact of a country's national inventory capacity on the accuracy of the biomass statistics reported to the FRA. We also reassessed previous remote sensing AGB maps and identified major biases compared to inventory data, up to 120 \% of the inventory value in dry tropical forests, in the subtropics and temperate zone. Because of the high level of detail and the overall reliability of the AGB spatial patterns, our global dataset of AGB is likely to have significant impacts on climate, carbon, and socio-economic modelling schemes and provides a crucial baseline in future carbon stock change estimates. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.894711 (Santoro, 2018).},

Shared ancestry explained 60--94\% of the total variance in foliar nutrient concentrations and ratios whereas current climate, atmospheric N deposition and soil type together explained 1--7\%, consistent with the biogeochemical niche hypothesis which predicts that each species will have a specific need for and use of each bio-element. The remaining variance was explained by the avoidance of nutritional competition with other species and natural variability within species. The biogeochemical niche hypothesis is thus able to quantify species-specific tree niches and their shifts in response to environmental changes.},

We show here an updated estimate of the net land carbon sink (NLS) as a function of time from 1960 to 2007 calculated from the difference between fossil fuel emissions, the observed atmospheric growth rate, and the ocean uptake obtained by recent ocean model simulations forced with reanalysis wind stress and heat and water fluxes. Except for interannual variability, the net land carbon sink appears to have been relatively constant at a mean value of -0.27 Pg C yr-1 between 1960 and 1988, at which time it increased abruptly by -0.88 (-0.77 to -1.04) Pg C yr-1 to a new relatively constant mean of -1.15 Pg C yr-1 between 1989 and 2003/7 (the sign convention is negative out of the atmosphere). This result is detectable at the 99\% level using a t-test. The land use source (LU) is relatively constant over this entire time interval. While the LU estimate is highly uncertain, this does imply that most of the change in the net land carbon sink must be due to an abrupt increase in the land sink, LS = NLS -- LU, in response to some as yet unknown combination of biogeochemical and climate forcing. A regional synthesis and assessment of the land carbon sources and sinks over the post 1988/1989 period reveals broad agreement that the Northern Hemisphere land is a major sink of atmospheric CO2, but there remain major discrepancies with regard to the sign and magnitude of the net flux to and from tropical land.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Here we integrate data from 21 different international studies in a meta-analysis of the displacement factors of wood products substituted in place of non-wood materials. We calculate the displacement factors in consistent units of tons of carbon (tC) of emission reduction per tC in wood product. The displacement factors range from a low of -2.3 to a high of 15, with most lying in the range of 1.0 to 3.0. The average displacement factor value is 2.1, meaning that for each tC in wood products substituted in place of non-wood products, there occurs an average GHG emission reduction of approximately 2.1 tC. Expressed in other units, this value corresponds to roughly 3.9 t CO2 eq emission reduction per ton of dry wood used. The few cases of negative displacement factors are the result of worst-case scenarios that are unrealistic in current practice. This meta-analysis quantifies the range of GHG benefits of wood substitution, and provides a clear climate rationale for increasing wood substitution in place of other products, provided that forests are sustainably managed and that wood residues are used responsibly. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Abstract. Understanding and quantifying the global methane (CH4) budget is important for assessing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change. Atmospheric emissions and concentrations of CH4 continue to increase, making CH4 the second most important human-influenced greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing, after carbon dioxide (CO2). The relative importance of CH4 compared to CO2 depends on its shorter atmospheric lifetime, stronger warming potential, and variations in atmospheric growth rate over the past decade, the causes of which are still debated. Two major challenges in reducing uncertainties in the atmospheric growth rate arise from the variety of geographically overlapping CH4 sources and from the destruction of CH4 by short-lived hydroxyl radicals (OH). To address these challenges, we have established a consortium of multidisciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate new research aimed at improving and regularly updating the global methane budget. Following Saunois et al. (2016), we present here the second version of the living review paper dedicated to the decadal methane budget, integrating results of top-down studies (atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up estimates (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven extrapolations). For the 2008--2017 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by atmospheric inversions (a top-down approach) to be 576 Tg CH4 yr-1 (range 550--594, corresponding to the minimum and maximum estimates of the model ensemble). Of this total, 359 Tg CH4 yr-1 or {$\sim$} 60 \% is attributed to anthropogenic sources, that is emissions caused by direct human activity (i.e. anthropogenic emissions; range 336--376 Tg CH4 yr-1 or 50 \%--65 \%). The mean annual total emission for the new decade (2008--2017) is 29 Tg CH4 yr-1 larger than our estimate for the previous decade (2000--2009), and 24 Tg CH4 yr-1 larger than the one reported in the previous budget for 2003--2012 (Saunois et al., 2016). Since 2012, global CH4 emissions have been tracking the warmest scenarios assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Bottom-up methods suggest almost 30 \% larger global emissions (737 Tg CH4 yr-1, range 594--881) than top-down inversion methods. Indeed, bottom-up estimates for natural sources such as natural wetlands, other inland water systems, and geological sources are higher than top-down estimates. The atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget suggest that at least some of these bottom-up emissions are overestimated. The latitudinal distribution of atmospheric observation-based emissions indicates a predominance of tropical emissions ({$\sim$} 65 \% of the global budget,},

  abstract = {In Europe, 23\% of the generated municipal solid waste (MSW) was landfilled in 2017. Despite the landfill targets which define waste and landfill requirements, there is still high variability in the waste management performance between EU Member States. Aim of the study was to give an overview of the variability of environmental impacts of MSW sanitary landfills in Europe in relation to the different levels of implementation of the requirements. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was adopted as tool to define the impacts of the different landfill conditions over a 100-year period. Based on previous studies, consistent methodological choices were made to allow comparability of the results. Four reference cases were defined based on average bulk MSW compositions to represent the European conditions, with L0 values of 18, 61, 90 and 138 [m3 CH4/t waste]. Furthermore, multiple scenario analysis was used to increase the relevance of the assessment and address the variability of site-specific factors, such as waste composition, climatic conditions and landfill management, which influence the impacts of landfills. Results of the study showed the range of potential impacts in Europe in relation to the variation of influencing factors, with values for climate change ranging from 124 to 841 kg CO2 eq., and with environmental savings obtained for categories such as ecotoxicity and human toxicity for scenarios with landfill gas - to - energy (LFGTE) solutions. The results emphasized the dependence of landfill impacts on waste composition, but also on the LFG treatment and climatic conditions. The outcome of the study also highlight how low amounts of biodegradable fractions reduce the impacts of landfills, as well as their variability in relation to leachate production rates or LFG treatment solutions. Therefore the overall results support the current targets and requirements reported in the Waste Directive 2008/98/EC, Circular Economy package and Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC.},

The objective of this study was to estimate the difference in dietary GHG emissions between self-selected meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK. Subjects were participants in the EPIC-Oxford cohort study. The diets of 2,041 vegans, 15,751 vegetarians, 8,123 fish-eaters and 29,589 meat-eaters aged 20--79 were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Comparable GHG emissions parameters were developed for the underlying food codes using a dataset of GHG emissions for 94 food commodities in the UK, with a weighting for the global warming potential of each component gas. The average GHG emissions associated with a standard 2,000~kcal diet were estimated for all subjects. ANOVA was used to estimate average dietary GHG emissions by diet group adjusted for sex and age. The age-and-sex-adjusted mean (95~\% confidence interval) GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents per day (kgCO2e/day) were 7.19 (7.16, 7.22) for high meat-eaters ({$>$} = 100~g/d), 5.63 (5.61, 5.65) for medium meat-eaters (50-99~g/d), 4.67 (4.65, 4.70) for low meat-eaters ({$<$} 50~g/d), 3.91 (3.88, 3.94) for fish-eaters, 3.81 (3.79, 3.83) for vegetarians and 2.89 (2.83, 2.94) for vegans. In conclusion, dietary GHG emissions in self-selected meat-eaters are approximately twice as high as those in vegans. It is likely that reductions in meat consumption would lead to reductions in dietary GHG emissions.},

However, several different definitions of vegetation crown cover are commonly measured and used, and relating one against the other is often difficult. In this study we derive simple expressions relating mature forest crown cover (CC), foliage projective cover (FPC) and leaf area index (LAI) using canopy gap fraction and canopy clumping theory. The relationship between FPC and CC is shown to be related to the ratio of the within canopy to between canopy clumping. A comprehensive field data set collected in forests and woodlands across Queensland is used to demonstrate the validity of the models. The results have widespread application in the modelling and analysis of forest structure. Introduction Cover of natural systems is complex to describe and map. In remote sensing, several measurements of vegetation crown cover are commonly used. These are crown cover (CC), foliage projective cover (FPC) and leaf area index (LAI). CC is defined as the percentage of ground area covered by the vertical projection of crowns, which in this case are assumed opaque. FPC is the percentage of ground area covered by the vertical projection of foliage (Walker and Hopkins 1990). LAI is defined here as half the total developed area of leaves per unit ground horizontal surface area (Chen et al. 1997).},

  abstract = {Forest management greatly influences biodiversity across spatial scales. At the landscape scale, combining management systems that create different stand properties might promote biodiversity due to complementary species assemblages. In European beech forests, nature conservation and policy advocate a mixture of unmanaged (UNM) forests and uneven-aged (UEA) forests managed at fine spatial grain at the expense of traditionally managed even-aged shelterwood forests (EA). Evidence that such a landscape composition enhances forest biodiversity is still missing. We studied the biodiversity (species richness 0D, Shannon diversity 1D, Simpson diversity 2D) of 14 taxonomic groups from bacteria to vertebrates in `virtual' beech forest landscapes composed of varying shares of EA, UEA and UNM and investigated how {$\gamma$}-diversity responds to landscape composition. Groups were sampled in the largest contiguous beech forest in Germany, where EA and UEA management date back nearly two centuries, while management was abandoned 20--70~years ago (UNM). We used a novel resampling approach that created all compositional combinations of management systems. Pure EA landscapes preserved a maximum of 97.5\% {$\gamma$}-multidiversity (0D, 1D) across all taxa. Pure and mixed UEA/UNM landscapes reduced {$\gamma$}-multidiversity by up to 12.8\% (1D). This effect was consistent for forest specialists (1D: -15.3\%). We found only weak complementarity among management systems. Landscape composition significantly affected {$\gamma$}-diversity of 6--9 individual taxa, depending on the weighting of species frequencies with strongest responses for spiders, beetles, vascular plants and birds. Most showed maximum diversity in pure EA landscapes. Birds benefited from UNM in EA-dominated landscapes. Deadwood fungi showed highest diversity in UNM. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that combining fine-grained forest management and management abandonment at the landscape scale will reduce, rather than enhance, regional forest biodiversity. We found an even-aged shelterwood management system alone operating at intermediate spatial scales and providing stands with high environmental heterogeneity was able to support regional biodiversity. However, some taxa require certain shares of uneven-aged and unmanaged forests, emphasizing their general importance. We encourage using the here presented resampling approach to verify our results in forest landscapes of different composition and configuration across the temperate zone.},

  abstract = {Schall et al. (2020) assessed how a combination of different forest management systems in managed forest landscapes dominated by European beech may affect the biodiversity (alpha, beta and gamma) of 14 taxonomic groups. Current forest policy and nature conservation often demand for combining uneven-aged managed and unmanaged, set-aside for nature conservation, beech forests in order to promote biodiversity. In contrast to this, Schall et al. (2020) found even-aged shelterwood forests, represented by different developmental phases, to support highest regional (gamma) diversity. By pointing out that unmanaged forests included in our study are not old-growth forests, Bruun and Heilmann-Clausen (2021) challenge our conclusion as not providing sound scientific advice to societies. It is true that the studied unmanaged forests are not representing old-growth forests as defined in the literature. However, we demonstrate the representativeness of our unmanaged forests for current beech forest landscapes of Central Europe, where managed forests were more or less recently set-aside in order to develop old-growth structures. We also show that the managed and recently unmanaged forests in our study already differ distinctively in their forest structures. We use this response to stress the role of forest reserves for promoting certain species groups, and to emphasise their importance as valuable research sites today and in the future. Synthesis and applications. We see two main conclusions from our study. First, unmanaged forests still matter. We agree with Bruun and Heilmann-Clausen (2021) on the general importance of unmanaged, old-growth or long-untouched forests, and we do not question the importance of set-aside forests for biodiversity conservation. However, a complete complementarity to managed systems may only reveal after many decades of natural development. Second, safeguarding biodiversity in largely managed forest landscapes should focus on providing a landscape matrix of different developmental phases with varying environmental conditions rather than on maximising the vertical structure within stands. Such landscapes can partly compensate for structures that are still missing in vital, dense and closed forests recently set-aside or for unsuitable phases that may occur due to a cyclic synchronisation of forest structures in unmanaged forests.},

Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},

Although resilience has been a highly influential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations. A first set of methods is based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point. Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natural fluctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the system-specific knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems.},

  abstract = {This paper, based on a literature review, presents a quantitative overview of the role of natural disturbances in European forests from 1850 to 2000. Such an overview provides a basis for modelling the possible impacts of climate change and enables one to assess trends in disturbance regimes in different countries and/or periods. Over the period 1950-2000, an annual average of 35 million m3 wood was damaged by disturbances; there was much variation between years. Storms were responsible for 53\% of the total damage, fire for 16\%, snow for 3\% and other abiotic causes for 5\%. Biotic factors caused 16\% of the damage, and half of this was caused by bark beetles. For 7\% of the damage, no cause was given or there was a combination of causes. The 35 million m3 of damage is about 8.1\% of the total fellings in Europe and about 0.15\% of the total volume of growing stock. Over the period 1961-2000, the average annual area of forest fires was 213 000 ha, which is 0.15\% of the total forest area in Europe. Most types of damage seem to be increasing. This is partly an artefact of the improved availability of information. The most likely explanations for an increase in damage from disturbances are changes in forest management and resulting changes in the condition of the forest. Forest area, average volume of growing stock and average stand age have increased considerably, making the forest more vulnerable and increasing the resources that can be damaged. Since forest resources are expected to continue to increase, it is likely that damage from disturbances will also increase in future.},

We combine insights into detailed studies at high resolution with the actual status of the forest and a realistic estimate of the current management practices at large scale. Results show that the European forest system is very inert and that it takes a long time to influence the species distribution by replacing species after final felling. By 2070, on average about 36~\% of the area expected to have decreased species suitability will have changed species following business as usual management. Alternative management, consisting of shorter rotations for those species and species planting based on expected trends, will have increased this species transition to 40~\%. The simulated forward-looking alternative management leads to some reduction in increment, but does not influence the amount of wood removed from the forest. Northern Europe is projected to show the highest production increases under climate change and can also adapt faster to the new (proposed) species distribution. Southwest Europe is expected to face the greatest challenge by a combination of a predicted loss of production and a slow rate of management alteration under climate change.},

Often when trying to simulate future forest resources under alternative futures, simply the yield table style of harvesting is applied. It is now crucially important to come to grips with actual forest management, now that demand for wood is increasing and the EU Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Regulation has been adopted requiring `continuation of current management practices' as a baseline to set the Forest Reference Level carbon sink. Methods Based on a large dataset of 714,000 re-measured trees in National Forest inventories from 13 regions, we are now able to analyse actual forest harvesting. Conclusions From this large set of repeated tree measurements we can conclude that there is no such thing as yield table harvesting in Europe. We found general trends of increasing harvest probability with higher productivity of the region and the species, but with important deviations related to local conditions like site accessibility, state of the forest resource (like age), specific subsidies, importance of other forest services, and ownership of the forest. As a result, we find a huge diversity in harvest regimes. Over the time period covered in our inventories, the average harvest probability over all regions was 2.4\% yr-1 (in number of trees) and the mortality probability was 0.4\% yr-1. Our study provides underlying and most actual data that can serve as a basis for quantifying `continuation of current forest management'. It can be used as a cornerstone for the base period as required for the Forest Reference Level for EU Member States.},

Our results suggest that the ecological contrast in floral resources created by schemes drives the response of pollinators to AES but that this response is moderated by landscape context and farmland type, with more positive responses in croplands (vs. grasslands) located in simple (vs. cleared or complex) landscapes. These findings inform us how to promote pollinators and associated pollination services in species-poor landscapes.

  abstract = {To be able to simulate climate change effects on forest dynamics over the whole of Switzerland, we adapted the second-generation DGVM (dynamic global vegetation model) LPJ-GUESS (Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator) to the Alpine environment. We modified model functions, tuned model parameters, and implemented new tree species to represent the potential natural vegetation of Alpine landscapes. Furthermore, we increased the computational efficiency of the model to enable area-covering simulations in a fine resolution (1 km) sufficient for the complex topography of the Alps, which resulted in more than 32 000 simulation grid cells. To this aim, we applied the recently developed method GAPPARD (approximating GAP model results with a Probabilistic Approach to account for stand Replacing Disturbances) (Scherstjanoi et al., 2013) to LPJ-GUESS. GAPPARD derives mean output values from a combination of simulation runs without disturbances and a patch age distribution defined by the disturbance frequency. With this computationally efficient method, which increased the model's speed by approximately the factor 8, we were able to faster detect the shortcomings of LPJ-GUESS functions and parameters. We used the adapted LPJ-GUESS together with GAPPARD to assess the influence of one climate change scenario on dynamics of tree species composition and biomass throughout the 21st century in Switzerland. To allow for comparison with the original model, we additionally simulated forest dynamics along a north-south transect through Switzerland. The results from this transect confirmed the high value of the GAPPARD method despite some limitations towards extreme climatic events. It allowed for the first time to obtain area-wide, detailed high-resolution LPJ-GUESS simulation results for a large part of the Alpine region. {\copyright} Author(s) 2014.

  abstract = {Feedbacks from the terrestrial carbon cycle significantly affect future climate change. The CO2 concentration dependence of global terrestrial carbon storage is one of the largest and most uncertain feedbacks. Theory predicts the CO2 effect should have a tropical maximum, but a large terrestrial sink has been contradicted by analyses of atmospheric CO2 that do not show large tropical uptake. Our results, however, show significant tropical uptake and, combining tropical and extratropical fluxes, suggest that up to 60\% of the present-day terrestrial sink is caused by increasing atmospheric CO2. This conclusion is consistent with a validated subset of atmospheric analyses, but uncertainty remains. Improved model diagnostics and new space-based observations can reduce the uncertainty of tropical and temperate zone carbon flux estimates. This analysis supports a significant feedback to future atmospheric CO2 concentrations from carbon uptake in terrestrial ecosystems caused by rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This feedback will have substantial tropical contributions, but the magnitude of future carbon uptake by tropical forests also depends on how they respond to climate change and requires their protection from deforestation.},

Using the global integrated assessment model REMIND, we systematically compare region-specific mitigation strategies and challenges of reaching domestic net-zero carbon emissions in 2050. Embarking from different emission profiles and trends, we find that all of the regions have technological options and mitigation strategies to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Regional characteristics are mostly related to different land availability, population density and population trends: While Japan is resource limited with respect to onshore wind and solar power and has constrained options for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), their declining population significantly decreases future energy demand. In contrast, Australia and the US benefit from abundant renewable resources, but face challenges to curb industry and transport emissions given increasing populations and high per-capita energy use. In the EU, lack of social acceptance or EU-wide cooperation might endanger the ongoing transition to a renewable-based power system. CDR technologies are necessary for all regions, as residual emissions cannot be fully avoided by 2050. For Australia and the US, in particular, CDR could reduce the required transition pace, depth and costs. At the same time, this creates the risk of a carbon lock-in, if decarbonization ambition is scaled down in anticipation of CDR technologies that fail to deliver. Our results suggest that industrialized economies can benefit from cooperation based on common themes and complementary strengths. This may include trade of electricity-based fuels and materials as well as the exchange of regional experience on technology scale-up and policy implementation.},

  abstract = {Inclusion of spatially explicit information on ecosystem services in conservation planning is a fairly new practice. This study analyses how the incorporation of ecosystem services as conservation features can affect conservation of forest biodiversity and how different opportunity cost constraints can change spatial priorities for conservation. We created spatially explicit cost-effective conservation scenarios for 59 forest biodiversity features and five ecosystem services in the county of Telemark (Norway) with the help of the heuristic optimisation planning software, Marxan with Zones. We combined a mix of conservation instruments where forestry is either completely (non-use zone) or partially restricted (partial use zone). Opportunity costs were measured in terms of foregone timber harvest, an important provisioning service in Telemark. Including a number of ecosystem services shifted priority conservation sites compared to a case where only biodiversity was considered, and increased the area of both the partial (+36.2\%) and the non-use zone (+3.2\%). Furthermore, opportunity costs increased (+6.6\%), which suggests that ecosystem services may not be a side-benefit of biodiversity conservation in this area. Opportunity cost levels were systematically changed to analyse their effect on spatial conservation priorities. Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services trades off against timber harvest. Currently designated nature reserves and landscape protection areas achieve a very low proportion (9.1\%) of the conservation targets we set in our scenario, which illustrates the high importance given to timber production at present. A trade-off curve indicated that large marginal increases in conservation target achievement are possible when the budget for conservation is increased. Forty percent of the maximum hypothetical opportunity costs would yield an average conservation target achievement of 79\%. Copyright:},

  abstract = {In 2018, Central Europe experienced one of the most severe and long-lasting summer drought and heat wave ever recorded. Before 2018, the 2003 millennial drought was often invoked as the example of a ``hotter drought'', and was classified as the most severe event in Europe for the last 500 years. First insights now confirm that the 2018 drought event was climatically more extreme and had a greater impact on forest ecosystems of Austria, Germany and Switzerland than the 2003 drought. Across this region, mean growing season air temperature from April to October was more than 3.3{$^\circ$}C above the long-term average, and 1.2 {$^\circ$}C warmer than in 2003. Here, we present a first impact assessment of the severe 2018 summer drought and heatwave on Central European forests. In response to the 2018 event, most ecologically and economically important tree species in temperate forests of Austria, Germany and Switzerland showed severe signs of drought stress. These symptoms included exceptionally low foliar water potentials crossing the threshold for xylem hydraulic failure in many species and observations of widespread leaf discoloration and premature leaf shedding. As a result of the extreme drought stress, the 2018 event caused unprecedented drought-induced tree mortality in many species throughout the region. Moreover, unexpectedly strong drought-legacy effects were detected in 2019. This implies that the physiological recovery of trees was impaired after the 2018 drought event, leaving them highly vulnerable to secondary drought impacts such as insect or fungal pathogen attacks. As a consequence, mortality of trees triggered by the 2018 events is likely to continue for several years. Our assessment indicates that many common temperate European forest tree species are more vulnerable to extreme summer drought and heat waves than previously thought. As drought and heat events are likely to occur more frequently with the progression of climate change, temperate European forests might approach the point for a substantial ecological and economic transition. Our assessment also highlights the urgent need for a pan-European ground-based monitoring network suited to track individual tree mortality, supported by remote sensing products with high spatial and temporal resolution to track, analyse and forecast these transitions.},

The objective is to increase understanding on the climate effects of varying the forest management. Across all regions, prolonging rotations by 20\% leads on average to the largest additional net climate benefit until 2050 in both, saved emissions and temperature cooling, while decreasing harvests by 20\% leads to the cumulatively largest net climate benefits past 2050. In contrast, increasing harvests or decreasing the rotation period accordingly provokes temporally alternating net emissions, or slight net emission, respectively, regardless of a changing market displacement factor. However, future forest calamities might compromise potential additional temperature cooling from forests, while substitution effects, despite probable prospective decreases, require additional thorough and time explicit assessments, to provide more robust policy consultation.},

Ecosystem carbon dioxide uptake has offset nearly 10\% of Europe's fossil fuel emissions, but not all of this may be creditable under the rules of the Kyoto Protocol. Although this treaty recognizes the importance of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, scientific research has largely focused on carbon dioxide. Here we review recent estimates of European carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide fluxes between 2000 and 2005, using both top-down estimates based on atmospheric observations and bottom-up estimates derived from ground-based measurements. Both methods yield similar fluxes of greenhouse gases, suggesting that methane emissions from feedstock and nitrous oxide emissions from arable agriculture are fully compensated for by the carbon dioxide sink provided by forests and grasslands. As a result, the balance for all greenhouse gases across Europe's terrestrial biosphere is near neutral, despite carbon sequestration in forests and grasslands. The trend towards more intensive agriculture and logging is likely to make Europe's land surface a significant source of greenhouse gases. The development of land management policies which aim to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions should be a priority. {\copyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We compare sustainably managed with unmanaged forests in terms of their contribution to climate change mitigation based on published data. For sustainably managed forests, accounting of carbon (C) storage based on ecosystem biomass and products as required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is not sufficient to quantify their contribution to climate change mitigation. The ultimate value of biomass is its use for biomaterials and bioenergy. Taking Germany as an example, we show that the average removals of wood from managed forests are higher than stated by official reports, ranging between 56 and 86 mill. m3 year-1 due to the unrecorded harvest of firewood. We find that removals from one hectare can substitute 0.87 m3 ha-1 year-1 of diesel, or 7.4 MWh ha-1 year-1, taking into account the unrecorded firewood, the use of fuel for harvesting and processing, and the efficiency of energy conversion. Energy substitution ranges between 1.9 and 2.2 t CO2 equiv. ha-1 year-1 depending on the type of fossil fuel production. Including bioenergy and carbon storage, the total mitigation effect of managed forest ranges between 3.2 and 3.5 t CO2 equiv. ha-1 year-1. This is more than previously reported because of the full accounting of bioenergy. Unmanaged nature conservation forests contribute via C storage only about 0.37 t CO2 equiv. ha-1 year-1 to climate change mitigation. There is no fossil fuel substitution. Therefore, taking forests out of management reduces climate change mitigation benefits substantially. There should be a mitigation cost for taking forest out of management in Central Europe. Since the energy sector is rewarded for the climate benefits of bioenergy, and not the forest sector, we propose that a CO2 tax is used to award the contribution of forest management to fossil fuel substitution and climate change mitigation. This would stimulate the production of wood for products and energy substitution.},

Our results demonstrate that the terrestrial carbon uptake depends critically on the climate sensitivity of individual climate models, representing a large uncertainty of model estimates. In our simulations, the terrestrial biosphere is unlikely to become a strong source of carbon with any likely combination of CO2 and climate change in the absence of land use change, but the fraction of the emissions taken up by the terrestrial biosphere will decrease drastically with higher emissions.},

Knowledge about these biomass components is essential for carbon accounting, understanding forest nutrient cycling, and other applications. In this study, we compare additive AGB estimation (sum of estimated components) with direct AGB estimation using deep neural network (DNN) and random forest (RF) models. We utilise two point cloud DNNs: point-based Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) and Octree-based Convolutional Neural Network (OCNN). DNN and RF models were trained using a dataset comprised of 2336 sample plots from a mixed temperate forest in New Brunswick, Canada. Results indicate that additive AGB models perform similarly to direct models in terms of coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean square error (RMSE), and reduced the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by 22\% on average. Compared to RF, the DNNs provided a small improvement in performance, with OCNN explaining 5\% more variation in the data (R2 = 0.76) and reducing MAPE by 20\% on average. Overall, this study showcases the effectiveness of additive tree AGB models and highlights the potential of DNNs for enhanced AGB estimation. To further improve DNN performance, we recommend using larger training datasets, implementing hyperparameter optimization, and incorporating additional data such as multispectral imagery.},

However, to our knowledge, there are no multisite time series of arthropod occurrences across gradients of land-use intensity with which to confirm causal relationships. Moreover, it remains unclear which land-use types and arthropod groups are affected, and whether the observed declines in biomass and diversity are linked to one another. Here we analyse data from more than 1 million individual arthropods (about 2,700 species), from standardized inventories taken between 2008 and 2017 at 150 grassland and 140 forest sites in 3 regions of Germany. Overall gamma diversity in grasslands and forests decreased over time, indicating loss of species across sites and regions. In annually sampled grasslands, biomass, abundance and number of species declined by 67\%, 78\% and 34\%, respectively. The decline was consistent across trophic levels and mainly affected rare species; its magnitude was independent of local land-use intensity. However, sites embedded in landscapes with a higher cover of agricultural land showed a stronger temporal decline. In 30 forest sites with annual inventories, biomass and species number---but not abundance---decreased by 41\% and 36\%, respectively. This was supported by analyses of all forest sites sampled in three-year intervals. The decline affected rare and abundant species, and trends differed across trophic levels. Our results show that there are widespread declines in arthropod biomass, abundance and the number of species across trophic levels. Arthropod declines in forests demonstrate that loss is not restricted to open habitats. Our results suggest that major drivers of arthropod decline act at larger spatial scales, and are (at least for grasslands) associated with agriculture at the landscape level. This implies that policies need to address the landscape scale to mitigate the negative effects of land-use practices.},

While conceptual advances of adapting coupled social-ecological systems to environmental changes have been made recently, good practice examples at the operational level still remain rare. The current study presents the development of adaptation options for 164 550 ha of commercial forests under the stewardship of the Austrian Federal Forests (AFF). We used a comprehensive vulnerability assessment as analysis framework, employing ecosystem modeling and multicriteria decision analysis in a participatory approach with forest planers of the AFF. An assessment of the vulnerability of multiple ecosystem goods and services under current management served as the starting point for the development of adaptation options. Measures found to successfully reduce vulnerability include the promotion of mixed stands of species well adapted to emerging environmental conditions, silvicultural techniques fostering complexity, and increased management intensity. Assessment results for a wide range of site and stand conditions, stand treatment programs, and future climate scenarios were used to condense robust recommendations for adapting the management guidelines currently used by AFF practitioners. Overall, our results highlight the importance of timely adaptation to sustain forest goods and services and document the respective potential of silvicultural measures.},

  abstract = {Natural disturbances play a key role in ecosystem dynamics and are important factors for sustainable forest ecosystem management. Quantitative models are frequently employed to tackle the complexities associated with disturbance processes. Here we review the wide variety of approaches to modelling natural disturbances in forest ecosystems, addressing the full spectrum of disturbance modelling from single events to integrated disturbance regimes. We applied a general, process-based framework founded in disturbance ecology to analyze modelling approaches for drought, wind, forest fires, insect pests and ungulate browsing. Modelling approaches were reviewed by disturbance agent and mechanism, and a set of general disturbance modelling concepts was deduced. We found that although the number of disturbance modelling approaches emerging over the last 15 years has increased strongly, statistical concepts for descriptive modelling are still largely prevalent over mechanistic concepts for explanatory and predictive applications. Yet, considering the increasing importance of disturbances for forest dynamics and ecosystem stewardship under anthropogenic climate change, the latter concepts are crucial tool for understanding and coping with change in forest ecosystems. Current challenges for disturbance modelling in forest ecosystems are thus (i) to overcome remaining limits in process understanding, (ii) to further a mechanistic foundation in disturbance modelling, (iii) to integrate multiple disturbance processes in dynamic ecosystem models for decision support in forest management, and (iv) to bring together scaling capabilities across several levels of organization with a representation of system complexity that captures the emergent behaviour of disturbance regimes. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Scaling is widely recognized as a central issue in ecology. The associated cross-scale interactions and process transmutations make scaling (i.e. a change in spatial or temporal grain and extent) an important issue in understanding ecosystem structure and functioning. Moreover, current concepts of ecosystem stewardship, such as sustainability and resilience, are inherently scale-dependent. The importance of scale and scaling in the context of forest management is likely to further increase in the future because of the growing relevance of ecosystem services beyond timber production. As a result, a consideration of processes both below (e.g. leaf-level carbon uptake in the context of climate change mitigation) and above (e.g. managing for biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale) the traditional focus on the stand level is required in forest ecosystem management. Furthermore, climate change will affect a variety of ecosystem processes across scales, ranging from photosynthesis (tree organs) to disturbance regimes (landscape scale). Assessing potential climate change impacts on ecosystem services thus requires a multi-scale perspective. However, scaling issues have received comparatively little attention in the forest management community to date. Our objectives here are thus first, to synthesize scaling issues relevant to forest management and second, to elucidate ways of dealing with complex scaling problems by highlighting examples of how they can be addressed with ecosystem models. We have focused on three current management issues of particular importance in European forestry: (1) climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration, (2) multi-functional stand management for biodiversity and non-timber goods and services and (3) improving the resilience to natural disturbances. We conclude that taking into account the full spatiotemporal heterogeneity and dynamics of forest ecosystems in management decision-making is likely to make management more robust to increasing environmental and societal pressures. Models can aid this process through explicitly accounting for system dynamics and changing conditions, operationally addressing the complexity of cross-scale interactions and emerging properties. Our synthesis indicates that increased attention to scaling issues can help forest managers to integrate traditional management objectives with emerging concerns for ecosystem services and therefore deserves more attention in forestry. {\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Climatic changes were identified as a key driver behind this increase, yet how the expected continuation of climate change will affect Europe's forest disturbance regime remains unresolved. Increasing disturbances could strongly impact the forest carbon budget, and are suggested to contribute to the recently observed carbon sink saturation in Europe's forests. Here we show that forest disturbance damage in Europe has continued to increase in the first decade of the twenty-first century. On the basis of an ensemble of climate change scenarios we find that damage from wind, bark beetles and forest fires is likely to increase further in coming decades, and estimate the rate of increase to be +0.91 {\texttimes} 10 6 m 3 of timber per year until 2030. We show that this intensification can offset the effect of management strategies aiming to increase the forest carbon sink, and calculate the disturbance-related reduction of the carbon storage potential in Europe's forests to be 503.4 Tg C in 2021-2030. Our results highlight the considerable carbon cycle feedbacks of changing disturbance regimes, and underline that future forest policy and management will require a stronger focus on disturbance risk and resilience.{\copyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Warmer and drier conditions particularly facilitate fire, drought and insect disturbances, while warmer and wetter conditions increase disturbances from wind and pathogens. Widespread interactions between agents are likely to amplify disturbances, while indirect climate effects such as vegetation changes can dampen long-term disturbance sensitivities to climate. Future changes in disturbance are likely to be most pronounced in coniferous forests and the boreal biome. We conclude that both ecosystems and society should be prepared for an increasingly disturbed future of forests.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing is a key information source for improving the spatiotemporal understanding of forest ecosystem dynamics. Yet, the mapping and attribution of forest change remains challenging, particularly in areas where a number of interacting disturbance agents simultaneously affect forest development. The forest ecosystems of Central Europe are coupled human and natural systems, with natural and human disturbances affecting forests both individually and in combination. To better understand the complex forest disturbance dynamics in such systems, we utilize 32-year Landsat time series to map forest disturbances in five sites across Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia. All sites consisted of a National Park and the surrounding forests, reflecting three management zones of different levels of human influence (managed, protected, strictly protected). This allowed for a comparison of spectral, temporal, and spatial disturbance patterns across a gradient from natural to coupled human and natural disturbances. Disturbance maps achieved overall accuracies ranging from 81\% to 93\%. Disturbance patches were generally small, with 95\% of the disturbances being smaller than 10~ha. Disturbance rates ranged from 0.29\% yr-1 to 0.95\% yr-1, and differed substantially among management zones and study sites. Natural disturbances in strictly protected areas were longer in duration (median of 8~years) and slightly less variable in magnitude compared to human-dominated disturbances in managed forests (median duration of 1~year). However, temporal dynamics between natural and human-dominated disturbances showed strong synchrony, suggesting that disturbance peaks are driven by natural events affecting managed and unmanaged areas simultaneously. Our study demonstrates the potential of remote sensing for mapping forest disturbances in coupled human and natural systems, such as the forests of Central Europe. Yet, we also highlight the complexity of such systems in terms of agent attribution, as many natural disturbances are modified by management responding to them outside protected areas.},

The forest ecosystems of Central Europe have recently been affected by unprecedented levels of natural disturbance, yet our understanding of their ability to recover from disturbances is still limited. Objectives: We here integrated satellite and airborne Lidar data to (i) quantify multi-decadal post-disturbance recovery of two indicators of forest structure, and (ii) compare the recovery trajectories of forest structure among managed and un-managed forests. Methods: We developed satellite-based models predicting Lidar-derived estimates of tree cover and stand height at 30 m grain across a 3100 km2 landscape in the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem (Central Europe). We summarized the percentage of disturbed area that recovered to {$>$} 40\% tree cover and {$>$} 5 m stand height and quantified the variability in both indicators over a 30-year period. The analyses were stratified by three management regimes (managed, protected, strictly protected) and two forest types (beech-dominated, spruce-dominated). Results: We found that on average 84\% of the disturbed area met our recovery threshold 30 years post-disturbance. The rate of recovery was slower in un-managed compared to managed forests. Variability in tree cover was more persistent over time in un-managed forests, while managed forests strongly converged after a few decades post-disturbance. Conclusion: We conclude that current management facilitates the recovery of forest structure in Central European forest ecosystems. However, our results underline that forests recovered well from disturbances also in the absence of human intervention. Our analysis highlights the high resilience of Central European forest ecosystems to recent disturbances.},

In Europe, storms and fires have been identified as the most important abiotic disturbances in the recent past. Yet, how strongly these agents drive local disturbance regimes compared to other agents (e.g., biotic, human) remains unresolved. Furthermore, whether storms and fires are responsible for the observed increase in forest disturbances in Europe is debated. Here, we provide quantitative evidence for the prevalence of storm and fire disturbances in Europe 1986--2016. For 27 million disturbance patches mapped from satellite data, we determined whether they were caused by storm or fire, using a random forest classifier and a large reference dataset of true disturbance occurrences. We subsequently analyzed patterns of disturbance prevalence (i.e., the share of an agent on the overall area disturbed) in space and time. Storm- and fire-related disturbances each accounted for approximately 7\% of all disturbances recorded in Europe in the period 1986--2016. Storm-related disturbances were most prevalent in western and central Europe, where they locally accounted for {$>$}50\% of all disturbances, but we also identified storm-related disturbances in south-eastern and eastern Europe. Fire-related disturbances were a major disturbance agent in southern and south-eastern Europe, but fires also occurred in eastern and northern Europe. The prevalence and absolute area of storm-related disturbances increased over time, whereas no trend was detected for fire-related disturbances. Overall, we estimate an average of 127,716 (97,680--162,725) ha of storm-related disturbances per year and an average of 141,436 (107,353--181,022) ha of fire-related disturbances per year. We conclude that abiotic disturbances caused by storm and fire are important drivers of forest dynamics in Europe, but that their influence varies substantially by region. Our analysis further suggests that increasing storm-related disturbances are an important driver of Europe's changing forest disturbance regimes.},

  abstract = {A displacement factor (DF) may be used to describe the efficiency of using wood-based products or fuels instead of fossil-based ones to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the DFs of individual products and their production volumes could not be used alone to evaluate the climate impacts of forest utilization. For this reason, in this study we have developed a methodology to assess a required displacement factor (RDF) for all wood products and bioenergy manufactured and harvested in a certain country in order to achieve zero CO2 equivalent emissions from increased forest utilization over time in comparison with a selected baseline harvesting scenario. Input data for calculations were produced with the simulation model, Monsu, capable of predicting the carbon stocks of forests and wood-based products. We tested the calculations in Finnish conditions in a 100-year time horizon and estimated the current average DF of manufactured wood-based products and fuels in Finland for the interpretation of RDF results. The results showed that if domestic wood harvesting will be increased by 17--33\% compared to the basic scenario, the RDF will be 2.0 to 2.4 tC tC-1 for increased wood use in 2017--2116. However, the estimated average DF of manufactured wood-based products and fuels currently in Finland was less than 1.1 tC tC-1. The results indicate strongly that the increased harvesting intensity from the current situation would represent a challenge for the Finnish forest-based bioeconomy from the viewpoint of climate change mitigation. For this reason, there is an immediate need to improve reliability and applicability of the RDF approach by repeating corresponding calculations in different circumstances and by improving estimations of DFs on country levels.},

But not all protection is effective and the reasons some countries' protected areas (PAs) are more effective than others' are poorly understood. We evaluate the effectiveness of national PA networks established between 2000 and 2012 globally in avoiding forest loss, taking into account underlying deforestation threats using a combination of matching methods and cross-sectional regressions. We then assess which demographic, agricultural, economic, and governance factors are most strongly associated with national PA effectiveness using machine learning methods. We estimate that national PAs established between 2000 and 2012 reduced deforestation in those areas by 72\%, avoiding 86 062 km               2               of forest loss. The effectiveness of national PAs varied by strictness of protection based on International Union for Conservation of Nature category. Strictly PAs reduced forest loss by 81\% compared to what would have occurred without protection, while less strictly PAs reduced forest loss by 67\%. Thus, the 26\% of new PAs that were strictly protected contributed 39\% of the total forest loss avoided within PAs between 2000 and 2012. If every country's PAs were as effective as the country with the most effective PAs within the same region, they would have increased the area of deforestation avoided by 38\%, saving a further 119 082 km               2               of forest. Part of the variation in PA effectiveness across countries is explained by the placement of PA in areas facing higher deforestation threat. Countries with lower agricultural activity, higher economic growth and better governance are most strongly associated with greater country-level PA effectiveness.},

In this study, we used long-term (10--30 years) net ecosystem productivity (NEP) measurements from 60 forest sites across the world (1003 site-years) to quantify long-term changes in forest NEP resistance and NEP recovery in response to extreme atmospheric dryness. We tested two hypotheses: first, across sites differences in NEP resistance and NEP recovery of forests will depend on both the biophysical characteristics (i.e., leaf area index [LAI] and forest type) of the forest as well as on the local meteorological conditions of the site (i.e., mean VPD of the site), and second, forests experiencing an increasing trend in frequency and intensity of extreme dryness will show an increasing trend in NEP resistance and NEP recovery over time due to emergence of long-term ecological stress memory. We used a data-driven statistical learning approach to quantify NEP resistance and NEP recovery over multiple years. Our results showed that forest types, LAI, and median local VPD conditions explained over 50\% of variance in both NEP resistance and NEP recovery, with drier sites showing higher NEP resistance and NEP recovery compared to sites with less atmospheric dryness. The impact of extreme atmospheric dryness events on NEP lasted for up to 3 days following most severe extreme events in most forests, indicated by an NEP recovery of less than 100\%. We rejected our second hypothesis as we found no consistent relationship between trends of extreme VPD with trends in NEP resistance and NEP recovery across different forest sites, thus an increase in atmospheric dryness as it is predicted might not increase the resistance or recovery of forests in terms of NEP.},

One major objective of CSF is to increase forest carbon storage to combat rising atmospheric carbon or climate change mitigation. Fortuitously, increased forest carbon storage can work harmoniously with on-going Southern pine plantation forestry. With a Southern commercial focus, we show (1) traditional plantation practices such as genetic improvement, site preparation, weed control, and fertilization have aided increased forest carbon storage; (2) forest products and forest product carbon are essential to increase carbon storage beyond the stand-carbon baseline; (3) forest carbon data collection must be improved to realize climate change mitigation goals; and (4) additional avenues for future CSF research.},

  abstract = {Carbon allocation in vegetation is an important process in the terrestrial carbon cycle; it determines the fate of photoassimilates, and it has an impact on the time carbon spends in the terrestrial biosphere. Although previous studies have highlighted important conceptual issues in the definition and metrics used to assess carbon allocation, very little emphasis has been placed on the distinction between the allocation of carbon from gross primary production (GPP) and the allocation from net primary production (NPP). An important number of simulation models and conceptual frameworks are based on the concept that C is allocated from NPP, which implies that C is respired immediately after photosynthetic assimilation. However, empirical work that estimates the age of respired CO2 from vegetation tissue (foliage, stems, roots) shows that it may take from years to decades to respire previously produced photosynthates. The transit time distribution of carbon in vegetation and ecosystems, a metric that provides an estimate of the age of respired carbon, indicates that vegetation pools respire carbon of a wide range of ages, on timescales that are in conflict with the assumption that autotrophic respiration only consumes recently fixed carbon. In this contribution, we attempt to provide compelling evidence based on recent research on the age of respired carbon and the theory of timescales of carbon in ecosystems, with the aim to promote a change in the predominant paradigm implemented in ecosystem models where carbon allocation is based on NPP. In addition, we highlight some implications for understanding and modeling carbon dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems.},

The aim of this paper is to assess the contribution of solid biomass to renewables use in the EU. During 2010--2018 the share of solid biomass increased from 6.1\% to 8.0\% of total GFEC, an increase of almost 300 PJ. The paper identifies leading and lagging countries in biomass development by focusing on their current solid biomass share in GFEC. The study shows that leading countries have reached or are close to reach their target, while lagging countries are far from their targets. ETS and non-ETS targets play both a role in the growing use of solid biomass. Despite some challenges, the forest biomass sector allows the sustainable increase of bioenergy in the EU, when the harvest level remains below 90\% of net annual increment (except for natural disasters) and there is a stable division between fuelwood and harvested wood for solid products. Forests available for wood supply (FAWS) should be treated differently from non-FAWS areas (protected forests, biodiversity areas), because of different carbon dynamics. The EU Member States may wish to introduce a fixed ratio between FAWS and non FAWS areas, in order to optimally meet the corresponding wishes in EU's forest and biodiversity strategies.},

  abstract = {Agriculture provides for the most basic needs of humankind: food and fiber. The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015--2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications.},

The DGVMs are also coupled to a fast 'climate analogue model', based on the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model (GCM), and run into the future for four Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES): A1FI, A2, B1, B2. Results show that all DGVMs are consistent with the contemporary global land carbon budget. Under the more extreme projections of future environmental change, the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. In particular, large uncertainties are associated with the response of tropical vegetation to drought and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. The DGVMs show more divergence in their response to regional changes in climate than to increases in atmospheric CO2 content. All models simulate a release of land carbon in response to climate, when physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant production are not considered, implying a positive terrestrial climate-carbon cycle feedback. All DGVMs simulate a reduction in global net primary production (NPP) and a decrease in soil residence time in the tropics and extra-tropics in response to future climate. When both counteracting effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem function are considered, all the DGVMs simulate cumulative net land carbon uptake over the 21st century for the four SRES emission scenarios. However, for the most extreme A1FI emissions scenario, three out of five DGVMs simulate an annual net source of CO2 from the land to the atmosphere in the final decades of the 21st century. For this scenario, cumulative land uptake differs by 494PgC among DGVMs over the 21st century. This uncertainty is equivalent to over 50 years of anthropogenic emissions at current levels. {\copyright} Journal compilation {\copyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The land and ocean absorb on average just over half of the anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) every year. These CO2 "sinks" are modulated by climate change and variability. Here we use a suite of nine dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and four ocean biogeochemical general circulation models (OBGCMs) to estimate trends driven by global and regional climate and atmospheric CO2 in land and oceanic CO2 exchanges with the atmosphere over the period 1990--2009, to attribute these trends to underlying processes in the models, and to quantify the uncertainty and level of inter-model agreement. The models were forced with reconstructed climate fields and observed global atmospheric CO2; land use and land cover changes are not included for the DGVMs. Over the period 1990--2009, the DGVMs simulate a mean global land carbon sink of -2.4 {\textpm} 0.7 Pg C yr-1 with a small significant trend of -0.06 {\textpm} 0.03 Pg C yr-2 (increasing sink). Over the more limited period 1990--2004, the ocean models simulate a mean ocean sink of -2.2 {\textpm} 0.2 Pg C yr-1 with a trend in the net C uptake that is indistinguishable from zero (-0.01 {\textpm} 0.02 Pg C yr-2). The two ocean models that extended the simulations until 2009 suggest a slightly stronger, but still small, trend of -0.02 {\textpm} 0.01 Pg C yr-2. Trends from land and ocean models compare favourably to the land greenness trends from remote sensing, atmospheric inversion results, and the residual land sink required to close the global carbon budget. Trends in the land sink are driven by increasing net primary production (NPP), whose statistically significant trend of 0.22 {\textpm} 0.08 Pg C yr-2 exceeds a significant trend in heterotrophic respiration of 0.16 {\textpm} 0.05 Pg C yr-2 -- primarily as a consequence of widespread CO2 fertilisation of plant production. Most of the land-based trend in simulated net carbon uptake originates from natural ecosystems in the tropics (-0.04 {\textpm} 0.01 Pg C yr-2), with almost no trend over the northern land region, where recent warming and reduced rainfall offsets the positive impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 and changes in growing season length on carbon storage. The small uptake trend in the ocean models emerges because climate variability and change, and in particular increasing sea surface temperatures, tend to counter{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}-act the trend in ocean uptake driven by the increase in atmospheric CO2. Large uncertainty remains in the magnitude and sign of modelled carbon trends in several regions, as well as regarding the influence of land use and land cover changes on regional trends.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an introduction to the role of groundwater in watersheds, presents an overview of groundwater resources in British Columbia, and reviews the potential effects of forest management activities (e.g., harvest operations, road building, reforestation, management of mountain pine beetle infestation) on groundwater hydrology. A regional-scale classification of hydrogeologic landscapes for British Columbia is outlined, integrating major physiographic, biogeoclimatic, and groundwater regions. The classification considers characteristics of climate, geology, aquifer type, and interaction with surface water in a generalized way, and summarizes broad-scale expectations about the groundwater hydrology in each hydrogeologic landscape category. In all of the landscapes, a rise in the water table can be expected to follow forest harvesting, though the magnitude and duration of this increase vary according to the area's geology and topography. In wet, steep watersheds, for example, shallow groundwater flow is likely to increase, in turn leading to the potential for increased runoff and decreased slope stability. Local-scale water table changes are often more apparent than those at the regional scale.},

  abstract = {1 Advances in dynamic ecosystem modelling have made a number of different approaches to vegetation dynamics possible. Here we compare two models representing contrasting degrees of abstraction of the processes governing dynamics in real vegetation. 2 Model (a) (GUESS) simulates explicitly growth and competition among individual plants. Differences in crown structure (height, depth, area and LAI) influence relative light uptake by neighbours. Assimilated carbon is allocated individually by each plant to its leaf, fine root and sapwood tissues. Carbon allocation and turnover of sapwood to heartwood in turn govern height and diameter growth. 3 Model (b) (LPJ) incorporates a `dynamic global vegetation model' (DGVM) architecture, simulating growth of populations of plant functional types (PFTs) over a grid cell, integrating individual-level processes over the proportional area (foliar projective cover, FPC) occupied by each PFT. Individual plants are not simulated, but are replaced by explicit parameterizations of their growth and interactions. 4 The models are identical in their representation of core physiological and biogeochemical processes. Both also use the same set of PFTs, corresponding to the major woody plant groups in Europe, plus a grass type. 5 When applied at a range of locations, broadly spanning climatic variation within Europe, both models successfully predicted PFT composition and succession within modern natural vegetation. However, the individual-based model performed better in areas where deciduous and evergreen types coincide, and in areas subject to pronounced seasonal water deficits, which would tend to favour grasses over drought-intolerant trees. 6 Differences in model performance could be traced to their treatment of individual-level processes, in particular light competition and stress-induced mortality. 7 Our results suggest that an explicit individualbased approach to vegetation dynamics may be an advantage in modelling of ecosystem structure and function at the resolution required for regionalto continental-scale studies.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the role of climate forcing agents other than carbon dioxide using the MiniCAM integrated assessment model for both no-climate-policy and policy emissions scenarios. Non-CO2 greenhouse-gas forcing is dominated by methane and tropospheric ozone. Assumptions about the prevalence of methane recovery and local air pollution controls in the no-policy cases are a critical determinant of methane and ozone-precursor emissions. When these factors are considered, emissions are substantially reduced relative to earlier estimates. This reduces their potential as climate mitigation agents through specific climate policies. Nevertheless, the addition of non-CO2 greenhouse gas and ozone precursor abatement options significantly reduces mitigation costs in the first half of the 21st century (by up to 40\%) compared to the case where only CO2 abatement options are pursued. While the influences of aerosols are small by the end of the century, there is a significant interaction in the early 21st century between policies to reduce CO2 emissions and SO2 emissions, even in the presence of SO2-related pollution control policies. The attendant reduced aerosol cooling can more than offset the reduction in warming that accruesfrom reduced CO2. When non-CO2 gases are included in the policy, the net effect is that global-mean climate change to 2050 is practically unaffected by mitigation policy. Copyright {\copyright} 2006 by the IAEE.

To account for such feedbacks, we implemented a novel plant individual-based vegetation dynamics-ecosystem biogeochemistry scheme within the RCA3 RCM. Variations in leaf area index (LAI) of seven plant functional type (PFTs) in response to physical forcing and evolving vegetation state feed back to climate via adjustments in surface energy fluxes and surface properties. In an ERA-40-driven simulation over Europe, the model reproduces the recent past climate with comparable accuracy to the standard RCM. Large-scale patterns of LAI, net primary production and vegetation composition were comparable with observations, although winter LAI was systematically overestimated compared to satellite estimates. Analysis of the ERA-40 simulation and an A1B climate-change simulation revealed considerable covariation among dynamic variables of the physical climate and vegetation. At a Mediterranean site, periodic soil water limitation led to fluctuations in leaf cover and a likely positive feedback to near-surface temperature. At an alpine site, rising temperatures led to forest advance onto tundra areas, reducing albedo and effecting a likely positive feedback on temperature. Climate-vegetation coupling was less pronounced but still apparent at intermediate temperate and boreal sites. {\copyright}2010 The Authors Tellus A{\copyright}2010 International Meteorological Institute in Stockholm.},

The LPJ-GUESS dynamic vegetation model uniquely combines an individual- and patch-based representation of vegetation dynamics with ecosystem biogeochemical cycling from regional to global scales. We present an updated version that includes plant and soil N dynamics, analysing the implications of accounting for C--N interactions on predictions and performance of the model. Stand structural dynamics and allometric scaling of tree growth suggested by global databases of forest stand structure and development were well reproduced by the model in comparison to an earlier multi-model study. Accounting for N cycle dynamics improved the goodness of fit for broadleaved forests. N limitation associated with low N-mineralisation rates reduces productivity of cold-climate and dry-climate ecosystems relative to mesic temperate and tropical ecosystems. In a model experiment emulating free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) treatment for forests globally, N limitation associated with low N-mineralisation rates of colder soils reduces CO2 enhancement of net primary production (NPP) for boreal forests, while some temperate and tropical forests exhibit increased NPP enhancement. Under a business-as-usual future climate and emissions scenario, ecosystem C storage globally was projected to increase by ca. 10\%; additional N requirements to match this increasing ecosystem C were within the high N supply limit estimated on stoichiometric grounds in an earlier study. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for C--N interactions in studies of global terrestrial N cycling, and as a basis for understanding mechanisms on local scales and in different regional contexts.},

Most recent scenarios from integrated assessment models require large-scale deployment of negative emissions technologies ( NET s) to reach the 2 {$^\circ$}C target. A recent analysis of NET s, including direct air capture, enhanced weathering, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and afforestation/deforestation, showed that all NET s have significant limits to implementation, including economic cost, energy requirements, land use, and water use. In this paper, I assess the potential for negative emissions from soil carbon sequestration and biochar addition to land, and also the potential global impacts on land use, water, nutrients, albedo, energy and cost. Results indicate that soil carbon sequestration and biochar have useful negative emission potential (each 0.7 GtCeq. yr -1 ) and that they potentially have lower impact on land, water use, nutrients, albedo, energy requirement and cost, so have fewer disadvantages than many NET s. Limitations of soil carbon sequestration as a NET centre around issues of sink saturation and reversibility. Biochar could be implemented in combination with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Current integrated assessment models do not represent soil carbon sequestration or biochar. Given the negative emission potential of SCS and biochar and their potential advantages compared to other NET s, efforts should be made to include these options within IAM s, so that their potential can be explored further in comparison with other NET s for climate stabilization.},

Previous work has assessed the impacts of tropical deforestation on precipitation, but these efforts have been largely limited to case studies 2 . A wider analysis of interactions between deforestation and precipitation---and especially how any such interactions might vary across spatial scales---is lacking. Here we show reduced precipitation over deforested regions across the tropics. Our results arise from a pan-tropical assessment of the impacts of 2003--2017 forest loss on precipitation using satellite, station-based and reanalysis datasets. The effect of deforestation on precipitation increased at larger scales, with satellite datasets showing that forest loss caused robust reductions in precipitation at scales greater than 50 km. The greatest declines in precipitation occurred at 200 km, the largest scale we explored, for which 1 percentage point of forest loss reduced precipitation by 0.25 {\textpm} 0.1 mm per month. Reanalysis and station-based products disagree on the direction of precipitation responses to forest loss, which we attribute to sparse in situ tropical measurements. We estimate that future deforestation in the Congo will reduce local precipitation by 8--10\% in 2100. Our findings provide a compelling argument for tropical forest conservation to support regional climate resilience.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The potential of forests and the forest sector to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is widely recognized, but challenging to quantify at a national scale. Forests and their carbon (C) sequestration potential are affected by management practices, where wood harvesting transfers C out of the forest into products, and subsequent regrowth allows further C sequestration. Here we determine the mitigation potential of the 2.3 {\texttimes} 106 km2 of Canada's managed forests from 2015 to 2050 using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3), a harvested wood products (HWP) model that estimates emissions based on product half-life decay times, and an account of emission substitution benefits from the use of wood products and bioenergy. We examine several mitigation scenarios with different assumptions about forest management activity levels relative to a base case scenario, including improved growth from silvicultural activities, increased harvest and residue management for bioenergy, and reduced harvest for conservation. We combine forest management options with two mitigation scenarios for harvested wood product use involving an increase in either long-lived products or bioenergy uses. Results demonstrate large differences among alternative scenarios, and we identify potential mitigation scenarios with increasing benefits to the atmosphere for many decades into the future, as well as scenarios with no net benefit over many decades. The greatest mitigation impact was achieved through a mix of strategies that varied across the country and had cumulative mitigation of 254 Tg CO2e in 2030, and 1180 Tg CO2e in 2050. There was a trade-off between short-term and long-term goals, in that maximizing short-term emissions reduction could reduce the forest sector's ability to contribute to longer-term objectives. We conclude that (i) national-scale forest sector mitigation options need to be assessed rigorously from a systems perspective to avoid the development of policies that deliver no net benefits to the atmosphere, (ii) a mix of strategies implemented across the country achieves the greatest mitigation impact, and (iii) because of the time delays in achieving carbon benefits for many forest-based mitigation activities, future contributions of the forest sector to climate mitigation can be maximized if implemented soon.},

Our modeling frameworks include the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector, a framework for harvested wood products that estimates emissions based on product half-life decay times, and an account of marginal emission substitution benefits from the changes in use of wood products and bioenergy. Using a spatially explicit forest inventory with 16 ha pixels, we examine mitigation scenarios relating to forest management and wood use: increased harvesting efficiency; residue management for bioenergy; reduced harvest; reduced slashburning, and more longer-lived wood products. The primary reason for the spatially explicit approach at this coarse resolution was to estimate transportation distances associated with delivering harvest residues for heat and/or electricity production for local communities. Results: Results demonstrated large differences among alternative scenarios, and from alternative assumptions about substitution benefits for fossil fuel-based energy and products which changed scenario rankings. Combining forest management activities with a wood-use scenario that generated more longer-lived products had the highest mitigation potential. Conclusions: The use of harvest residues to meet local energy demands in place of burning fossil fuels was found to be an effective scenario to reduce GHG emissions, along with scenarios that increased the utilization level for harvest, and increased the longevity of wood products. Substitution benefits from avoiding fossil fuels or emissions-intensive products were dependent on local circumstances for energy demand and fuel mix, and the assumed wood use for products. As projected future demand for biomass use in national GHG mitigation strategies could exceed sustainable biomass supply, analyses such as this can help identify biomass sources that achieve the greatest mitigation benefits.},

We study the trade-offs and synergies between these strategies using three different Finnish national-level forest scenarios between 2015 and 2044 as examples. We demonstrate how GHG emissions change when wood harvest rates are increased. We take into account CO 2 and other greenhouse gas flows in the forest, the decay rate of harvested wood products and fossil-based CO 2 emissions that can be avoided by substituting alternative materials with wood derived from increased harvests. We considered uncertainties of key parameters by using stochastic simulation. According to our results, an increase in harvest rates in Finland increased the total net GHG flow to the atmosphere virtually certainly or very likely, given the uncertainties and time frame considered. This was because the increased biomass-based CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere together with decreased carbon sequestration into the forest were very likely higher than the avoided fossil-based CO 2 emissions. The reverse of this conclusion would require that compared to what was studied in this paper, the share of long-living wood products in the product mix would be higher, carbon dioxide from bioenergy production would be captured and stored, and reduction in forest carbon equivalent net sink due to wood harvesting would be minimized.},

Disturbance patterns are highly variable, and shaped by variation in disturbance agents and traits of prevailing tree species.

Disturbances in protected areas are smaller and more complex in shape compared to their surroundings affected by human land use.

  abstract = {Foliage Projective Cover of the overstorey (canopy) of a`climax'community appears to reach an equilibrium value determined largely by the prevailing climate. Overstorey FPC decreases in`climax'communities in a graded series from humid to arid regions. Understorey cover (of all strata below the canopy) in`climax'communities attains a balance with overstorey FPC. Disturbance (gaps, microhabitats, fire, overgrazing, invasion of woody weeds, etc.) may reduce the overstorey cover which will be compensated by an increase in understorey cover. Secondary succession back to the`climax'structure will follow a path maintaining an inverse linear relationship between understorey cover and overstorey cover. At the same time, species diversity appears to decrease as overstorey cover increases. Copyright {\copyright} 1981, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

  abstract = {Hydraulic conductivity (K) in the sod and xylem declines as water potential ({$\Psi$}) declines. This results in a maximum rate of steady-state transpiration (E(crit)) and corresponding minimum leat {$\Psi$} ({$\Psi$}(crit)) at which K has approached zero somewhere in the soil-leaf continuum. Exceeding these limits causes water transport to cease. A model determined whether the point of hydraulic failure (where K = 0) occurred in the rhizosphere or xylem components of the continuum. Below a threshold of root:leaf area (A(R):A(L)), the loss of rhizosphere K limited E(crit) and {$\Psi$}(crit). Above the threshold, loss of xylem K from cavitation was limiting. The A(R):A(L) threshold ranged from {$>$} 40 for coarse soils and/or cavitation-resistant xylem to {$<$} 0.20 in fine soils and/or cavitation-susceptible xylem. Comparison of model results with drought experiments in sunflower and water birch indicated that stomatal regulation of E reflected the species' hydraulic potential for extracting soil water, and that the more sensitive stomatal response of water birch to drought was necessary to avoid hydraulic failure. The results suggest that plants should be xylem-limited and near their A(R):A(L) threshold. Corollary predictions are (1) within a soil type the A(R):A(L) should increase with increasing cavitation resistance and drought tolerance, and (2) across soil types from fine to coarse the A(R):A(L) should increase and maximum cavitation resistance should decrease.},

  abstract = {Key message: Mechanized cutting may result in higher stump damage levels, especially if cutting is performed with shears. Nevertheless, stumps cut with mechanized technology do not show higher mortality rates than do stumps cut manually with a chainsaw. One-year growth is also unaffected, and so is nutrient balance within the stump. Context: Coppice harvesting must be mechanized in order to modernize coppice management, so that it can grow along with the dynamic new bio-economy. However, foresters are concerned that mechanized cutting may result in higher stump damage levels, which may cause increased mortality and lower growth rates. Aims: The goal of the study was to compare manual and mechanized cutting in terms of cut quality, stump damage levels, stump mortality, re-sprouting vigor, and shoot growth. Methods: The study was conducted in a classic Mediterranean coppice stand located in central Italy. The oak-dominated coppice was cut using a chainsaw (control), a disk saw and a shear. The experiment adopted a split-plot design, based on 5 plots divided into 15 subplots (1 subplot per plot and technology). Overall, 344 stumps were selected, tagged, and monitored over the first growing season after cutting. Stump size, cutting height, and cutting damage were determined right after cutting. At the end of the first growing season, the following parameters were also recorded: no. of shoots; height, diameter, and type of the tallest five shoots. Samples were collected from randomly selected stumps during the main phenological phases in order to determine the content of C, N, starch, and soluble sugar, as well as the C/N ratio. Results: Mortality ranged from 4 to 8\%. Re-sprouting was generally vigorous, with dominant shoots often exceeding the height of 1.5~m after 1~year. Cutting technology had a significant effect on cutting height and cutting damage, but it had no effect on mortality, re-sprouting vigor, and nutrient balance within the stumps, at least in the first growing season. Re-sprouting vigor depended mainly on species. Conclusion: While it may result in higher stump damage levels, mechanized cutting does not seem to have any effects on coppice regeneration and growth, at least in the first year. Previous studies indicate that effects recorded during the first growing season may be representative of longer-term trends. The experiment will be continued to obtain additional confirmation.},

  abstract = {As a result of climate change in recent past and unsustainable land management, drought became one of the most impacting disasters and, with the projected global warming, it is expected to progressively cause more damages by the end of the 21st century. This study investigates changes in drought occurrence, frequency, and severity in Europe in the next decades. A combined indicator based on the predominance of the drought signal over normal/wet conditions has been used. The indicator, which combines the standardized precipitation index (SPI, which accounts for anomalous low rainfall), the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI, which accounts for high temperatures and scarce precipitations), and the reconnaissance drought indicator (RDI, similar to SPEI but more affected by extreme events), has been computed at 3- and 12-month accumulation scales to characterize trends in seasonal and annual events from 1981 to 2100. Climate data from 11 bias-adjusted high-resolution (0.11{$^\circ$}) simulations from the EURO-CORDEX (coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment) have been used in the analyses. For each simulation, the frequency and severity of drought and extreme drought events for 1981--2010, 2041--2070, and 2071--2100 have been analysed. Under the moderate emission scenario (RCP4.5), droughts are projected to become increasingly more frequent and severe in the Mediterranean area, western Europe, and Northern Scandinavia, whereas the whole European continent, with the exception of Iceland, will be affected by more frequent and severe extreme droughts under the most severe emission scenario (RCP8.5), especially after 2070. Seasonally, drought frequency is projected to increase everywhere in Europe for both scenarios in spring and summer, especially over southern Europe, and less intensely in autumn; on the contrary, winter shows a decrease in drought frequency over northern Europe.},

Here, we calculate local forest transpiration and the subsequent trajectories of transpired water through the atmosphere in high spatial and temporal detail. We estimate that one-third of Amazon rainfall originates within its own basin, of which two-thirds has been transpired. Forests in the southern half of the basin contribute most to the stability of other forests in this way, whereas forests in the south-western Amazon are particularly dependent on transpired-water subsidies. These forest-rainfall cascades buffer the effects of drought and reveal a mechanism by which deforestation can compromise the resilience of the Amazon forest system in the face of future climatic extremes.},

  abstract = {The European Union's Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 seeks to protect 30\% of land, with 10\% under strict pro\- tection, while building a transnational nature network. We explore the effects of the Biodiversity Strategy targets for land use and ecosystem services across the European land system. To do so, we propose a novel approach, combining a methodological framework for improving green network connectivity with an EU-wide land system model. We identify an improved network of EU protected areas consistent with the 2030 targets, and explore its effects under different levels of protection and in a range of paired climatic and socio-economic scenarios. The existing network of protected areas is highly fragmented, with more than one third of its nodes being isolated. We find that prioritizing connectivity when implementing new protected areas could achieve the strategy's targets without compromising the future provision of ecosystem services, including food production, in Europe. How\- ever, we also find that EU-wide distributions of land uses and ecosystem services are influenced by the protected area network, and that this influence manifests differently in different climatic and socio-economic scenarios. Varying the strength of protection of the network had limited effects. Extractive services (food and timber production) decreased in protected areas, but non-extractive services increased, with compensatory changes occurring outside the network. Changes were small where competition for land was low and scenario conditions were benign, but became far larger and more extensive where competition was high and scenario conditions were challenging. Our findings highlight the apparent achievability of the EU's protected area targets, but also the need to account for adaptation in the wider land system and its consequences for spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem services provision now and in the future.},

The paper provides an overview on past and recent coppice forest management in four selected countries in SEE: Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia, in which coppice forestry has been of significant importance. The following main coppice forest types have been recognised in respect to their past management and current condition: (i) traditional coppice forests; (ii) 'high coppice' forests; (iii) coppice forests for transformation and reconstruction; (iv) coppice forests with standards and 'middle-aged' forests; (v) pollarding forests; (vi) selection coppice forests; (vii) shelterbelts (windbreaks, erosion shelterbelts, etc); (viii) oak coppices for shelling; and (ix) coppice forests subjected to no management. The paper emphasizes the contribution of sustainable management of coppice forest resources to ecological stability and economic development of SEE, which could be achieved by both considering the traditional management concepts and introducing new ecologically, economically and socially sound management practices.},

However, species, diameter, and height are commonly measured and indicate changes in vertical and horizontal stand structure. Indices based on the distribution of basal area per hectare by diameter, height, and species were derived and evaluated by applying them to simulated and actual data sets with a wide variety of stand structures. Extending the Shannon index of diversity to proportions by species, diameter, and height resulted in reasonable results with more diverse structures having higher values. However, diameter and height ranges must be divided into classes to use these indices. A new index based on the variances of the target stand, relative to the variance of a uniformly distribution stand, showed similar diversity measures to that of the Shannon index, without the need for dividing the diameter and height data into classes. Examination of these indices for use in growth and yield modelling of complex stands is needed.},

We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System---biosphere, climate, and societies---and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.},

This paper reports results obtained with a comprehensive flow and storage model using whole-tree leaf transpiration as the only input variable. The model includes radial stem growth based on Lockhart's equation for irreversible cell expansion. It was demonstrated that including growth is essential to obtaining good simulation results. To model sap flow dynamics, capacitance of storage tissues was assumed either constant (i.e., electrical analogue approach) or variable and dependent on the water content of the respective storage tissue (i.e., hydraulic system approach). These approaches resulted in different shapes for the desorption curve used to calculate the capacitance of storage tissues. Comparison of these methods allowed detection of specific differences in model simulation of sap flow at the stem base (F(stem)) and stem diameter variation (D). Sensitivity analysis was performed to select a limited subset of identifiable parameters driving most of the variability in model predictions of F(stem) and D. Both the electrical analogue and the hydraulic system approach for the flow and storage model were successfully calibrated and validated for the case of a young beech tree (Fagus sylvatica L.). Use of an objective model selection criterion revealed that the flow and storage model based on the electrical analogue approach yielded better predictions. {\copyright} 2006 Heron Publishing.},

Although ambitious national and global targets have been set, global priority areas that account for spatial variation in benefits and costs have yet to be identified. Here we develop and apply a multicriteria optimization approach that identifies priority areas for restoration across all terrestrial biomes, and estimates their benefits and costs. We find that restoring 15\% of converted lands in priority areas could avoid 60\% of expected extinctions while sequestering 299 gigatonnes of CO2---30\% of the total CO2 increase in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. The inclusion of several biomes is key to achieving multiple benefits. Cost effectiveness can increase up to 13-fold when spatial allocation is optimized using our multicriteria approach, which highlights the importance of spatial planning. Our results confirm the vast potential contributions of restoration to addressing global challenges, while underscoring the necessity of pursuing these goals synergistically.},

  abstract = {A potential glacial lake outburst flood from Lake Palcacocha (Cordillera Blanca, Peru) threatens Huaraz, a city of 120,000 people. In 1941, an outburst flood destroyed one-third of the city and caused at least 1,800 fatalities. Since pre-industrial times, Lake Palcacocha has expanded due to the retreat of Palcaraju glacier. Here we used observations and numerical models to evaluate the anthropogenic contribution to the glacier's retreat and glacial lake outburst flood hazard. We found that the magnitude of human-induced warming equals between 85 and 105\% (5--95\% confidence interval) of the observed 1 {$^\circ$}C warming since 1880 in this region. We conclude that it is virtually certain ({$>$}99\% probability) that the retreat of Palcaraju glacier to the present day cannot be explained by natural variability alone, and that the retreat by 1941 represented an early impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Our central estimate is that the overall retreat is entirely attributable to the observed temperature trend, and that the resulting change in the geometry of the lake and valley has substantially increased the outburst flood hazard.},

  abstract = {Roughness height for heat transfer is a crucial parameter in estimation of heat transfer between the land surface and the atmosphere. Although many empirical formulations have been proposed over the past few decades, the uncertainties associated with these formulations are shown to be large, especially over sparse canopies. In this contribution, a simple physically based model is derived for the estimation of the roughness height for heat transfer. This model is derived from a complex physical model based on the "localized near-field" Lagrangian theory. This model (called Massman's model) and another recently proposed model derived by fitting simulation results of a simple multisource bulk transfer model (termed Bl{\"u}mel's model) are evaluated using three experimental datasets. The results of the model performances are judged by using the derived roughness values to compute sensible heat fluxes with the bulk transfer formulation and comparing these computed fluxes to the observed sensible heat fluxes. It is concluded, on the basis of comparison of calculated versus observed sensible heat fluxes, that both the current model and Bl{\"u}mel's model provide reliable estimates of the roughness heights for heat transfer. The current model is further shown to be able to explain the diurnal variation in the roughness height for heat transfer. On the basis of a sensitivity analysis, it is suggested that, although demanding, most of the information needed for both models is amendable by satellite remote sensing such that their global incorporation into large-scale atmospheric models for both numerical weather prediction and climate research merits further investigation.},

  abstract = {The ecological functions of vegetation play a significant role in improving human well-being. However, previous studies on ecological functions have only used semi-empirical models, which do not include physiological mechanisms and therefore do not accurately estimate the ecological functions of vegetation under scenarios of future climate change. To address this problem, a process-based dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) was used to simulate the ecological functions of vegetation under different climate change scenarios in the Loess Plateau (LP), a typical ecologically fragile area in China. The simulated ecological functions were the carbon stock function (CS), soil conservation function (SC), and the water conservation function (WC). The results showed that: (1) Compared with 2001--2020, the proportion of area by shrub and grass vegetation that was predicted to transform into forest accounted for more than 1\% of the area in the LP under the SSP119 scenario and 3\% of the area in the LP under the SSP585 scenario during 2081--2100, respectively. (2) Compared with 2001--2020, the CS would decrease in the central and south-eastern regions, the SC would decrease in the western regions, and the WC would decrease in the Qilian, Wushaoling, Xinglong and Liupan Mountains during 2081--2100. (3) The relationships and the corresponding regions between the ecological functions of the vegetation and the corresponding regions in the LP would change significantly under climate change from 2001--2020 to 2081--2100.These results indicate that a process-based dynamic vegetation model can capture the changes in the carbon and water fluxes under changes in the climate and CO2 concentration. It can also capture the vegetation succession, changes in ecological functions, and the transformation of functional relationships, which provide information that is conducive to the management and restoration of vegetation on the LP. This study supplies a novel perspective for vegetation management and high-quality development in other ecologically fragile regions worldwide.},

  abstract = {Windthrow disturbances often produce large amounts of dead woody materials in a forest. However, post-disturbance, salvage logging greatly reduces the amount of dead woody materials, and thus, carbon stocks. Because the dead woody materials can persist as coarse woody debris (CWD) for a very long time in cool climatic areas, such as boreal and subalpine forests, salvage logging might have long-term effects on the carbon stocks of disturbed forests. In this study, we examined the effects of windthrow by a super typhoon in 1959 and subsequent salvage logging on the carbon stock of subalpine forests more than a half-century after the disturbance in central Japan. We sampled disturbed and not salvaged (unsalvaged) stands versus disturbed and salvaged stands within 10 years of the disturbance (salvaged) in addition to undisturbed stands (undisturbed). The volume of CWD was higher in the unsalvaged stands versus the other two types of forests. Specifically, the volume of classes with intermediate decay was very high, contributing to greater carbon stocks of CWD in the unsalvaged stands. Although the carbon stock of living trees was higher in the undisturbed stands compared to the disturbed stands (unsalvaged and salvaged), the total carbon stock (live + dead) of the unsalvaged stands (104 Mg C ha-1) was almost equivalent to that of the undisturbed stands (99 Mg C ha-1) and was much higher than that of the salvaged stands (72 Mg C ha-1). This study demonstrates that CWD produced by a typhoon acts as a large carbon stock for more than a half-century, potentially offsetting the loss of live woody biomass in disturbed forests.},

  abstract = {Regional-scale tree die-off events driven by drought and warming and associated pests and pathogens have occurred recently on all forested continents and are projected to increase in frequency and extent with future warming. Within areas where tree mortality has occurred, ecological, hydrological and meteorological consequences are increasingly being documented. However, the potential for tree die-off to impact vegetation processes and related carbon dynamics in areas remote to where die-off occurs has rarely been systematically evaluated, particularly for multiple distinct regions within a given continent. Such remote impacts can occur when climate effects of local vegetation change are propagated by atmospheric circulation - the phenomena of 'ecoclimate teleconnections'. We simulated tree die-off events in the 13 most densely forested US regions (selected from the 20 US National Ecological Observatory Network [NEON] domains) and found that tree die-off even for smaller regions has potential to affect climate and hence Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) in disparate regions (NEON domains), either positively or negatively. Some regions exhibited strong teleconnections to several others, and some regions were relatively sensitive to tree loss regardless of what other region the tree loss occurred in. For the US as a whole, loss of trees in the Pacific Southwest - an area undergoing rapid tree die-off - had the largest negative impact on remote US GPP whereas loss of trees in the Mid-Atlantic had the largest positive impact. This research lays a foundation for hypotheses that identify how the effects of tree die-off (or other types of tree loss such as deforestation) can ricochet across regions by revealing hot-spots of forcing and response. Such modes of connectivity have direct applicability for improving models of climate change impacts and for developing more informed and coordinated carbon accounting across regions.},

CO2-induced climate warming scenarios cause major changes in these limits. The dominant conifers of the mixed conifer/northern hardwoods zone, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris, retreat from the south and west while Fagus sylvatica and other temperate hardwoods spread to the north. A gap model (FORSKA 2) is used to simulate the associated transient responses of a forest reserve within this zone. In both dry Pinus- and moist Picea-dominated forest communities, Picea continues to increase while Pinus sooner or later declines. These changes are continuing successional (non-climatic) responses to the cessation of disturbance 150 years ago. Climate warming speeds up the succession, and allows Fagus to establish and increase. The eventual decline of Picea however is delayed due to the persistence of old-growth stands. Picea forests subject to continuing disturbance show a more rapid shift to dominance by Fagus and other temperate hardwoods. Delayed immigration of new species, including Fagus, would favour early- successional species such as Betula pendula and Quercus spp. in a forest with reduced biomass and diversity. The results emphasise the complex and sometimes counter-intuitive nature of transient responses, and the importance of considering disturbance history and potential migration rates when predicting the impacts of rapid climate change on forests.},

Bioclimatic variables were computed from monthly means of temperature, precipitation and sunshine (\%) interpolated to a 10' grid taking into account elevation. Minimum values of mean coldest-month temperature (T-c) and 'effective' growing degree days (GDD*) were fitted to species' range limits. GDD* is total annual growing degree days (GDD) minus GDD to budburst (GDD(o)). Each species was assigned to one of the chilling-response categories identified by Murray, Cannell \& Smith (1989) to calculate GDD(o). Maximum T-c values were fitted to continental species' mild-winter limits and other deciduous species' warm-winter limits. Minimum values of relative growing-season moisture availability (alpha*) were estimated from silvics. Growth indices were calculated based on potential net assimilation (a quadratic in daily temperature) and alpha*. Growth can be rapid near a range limit, e.g. Picea abies (L.) Karsten in southern Sweden. Climate changes expected for CO2 doubling were projected on to the grid. Simulated distribution changes reflected interspecific differences in response to changing seasonality. Chilling responses proved important, e.g. the predicted range limit of Fagus sylvatica L. contracts in the west while expanding northwards as winters warm more than summers. Transient responses to climate change can be modelled using the same information provided that fundamental and realized niche limitations are distinguished-a caveat that underlines the dearth of experimental information on the climatic requirements for growth, and especially regeneration, of many important trees.},

We defined a modelling framework for calculation of the carbon pools and fluxes along the forest energy and wood product supply chains over 200 years for three forest management alternatives (FMA): 1) a traditionally managed European beech forest, as a business-as-usual case, 2) an energy poplar plantation, and 3) a set-aside forest left unmanaged for long-term storage of carbon. We calculated the cumulative net carbon emissions (CCE) and carbon parity times (CPT) of the managed forests relative to the unmanaged forest. Energy poplar generally had the lowest CCE when using coal as the reference fossil fuel. With natural gas as the reference fossil fuel, the CCE of the business-as-usual and the energy poplar was nearly equal, with the unmanaged forest having the highest CCE after 40 years. CPTs ranged from 0 to 156 years, depending on the applied model assumptions. CCE and CPT were especially sensitive to the reference fossil fuel, material alternatives to wood, forest growth rates for the three FMAs, and energy conversion efficiencies. Assumptions about the long-term steady-state levels of carbon stored in the unmanaged forest had a limited effect on CCE after 200 years. Analyses also showed that CPT was not a robust measure for ranking of carbon mitigation benefits.},

  abstract = {1. Multi-stemmed trees are an understudied but common component of temperate broadleaf forests that can provide insight into how plants persist and regenerate within communities. In particular, multi-stemmed architecture may be an important trait for the growth and survival of trees in forest understoreys that have to cope with low light levels, but this idea has been rarely tested using long-term individual-level data. 2. We use measurements of 8527 individual woody stems from 1985, 1996 and 2008 to model the growth, survival and recruitment of hazel (Corylus avellana) and hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata and C. monogyna) trees as a function of neighbourhood competition in the understorey of a minimum-intervention, mixed-ash woodland in England. We test the effects of browsing by deer (Muntiacus reevesi) on woodland dynamics by comparing demographic rates during a period of high deer densities (1985-1996) with rates recorded from 1996 to 2008, when sustained culling substantially reduced deer densities. 3. Growth and survival of hazel and hawthorn trees increased with the number of stems they possessed, demonstrating clear benefits to multi-stemmed architecture. Surviving trees continued to accumulate basal area and stems without any clear upper limit after 23years. However, increasing numbers of stems generally reduced the growth and recruitment of stems within multi-stemmed trees. 4. Temporal differences in deer browsing appeared to influence the strength of intra-specific (i.e. inter-stem) competition and, consequently, the growth, survival and recruitment of multi-stemmed trees. Most notably, stem survival declined with the number of stems in a tree only after deer culling, but not during a period of high deer densities, suggesting that intense deer browsing reduced resource competition among stems. Inter-specific neighbourhood competition had no detectable effect on hazel or hawthorn demography. 5. Synthesis. Multi-stemmed architecture is an advantageous trait for understorey trees in temperate woodlands relative to the allocation of resources towards the growth of a single stem. We suggest that the low light levels of forest understoreys favour 'persistence', through multi-stemmed growth, rather than 'regeneration' niches (i.e. periodic recruitment through seed), with the advantage of this life-history strategy influenced by herbivory and intra-specific competition. {\copyright} 2011 The Authors.

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes ``long term'' simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere--ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of ``near term'' simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These ``decadal predictions'' are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive.

  abstract = {While bark beetle disturbance is an inherent component of coniferous forest ecosystems throughout the northern hemisphere, associated tree mortality and ensuing changes in forest composition and structure may conflict with timber, wildlife, water and other resource management objectives. Therefore, host tree density reduction has been suggested as a management option to increase forest stand resistance to beetle infestation, protect remaining trees and maintain forest resources. However, little is known about the effectiveness of such treatments to mitigate spruce beetle (. Dendroctonus rufipennis) infestation or their influence on the stand structural controls of beetle disturbance in subalpine spruce-fir forests in the Rocky Mountains. We addressed this research gap in a retrospective assessment of the impact of density reduction treatments on stand composition and structure and subsequent (ca. 5-20. years later) spruce beetle infestation in southwestern Colorado. The study area was located at the fringe of an ongoing spruce beetle outbreak and at the time of sampling was affected by endemic to incipient beetle pressure. Stand structural attributes and beetle infestation were measured in treated and untreated control stands at four sites. Classification tree analyses revealed spruce diameter and its interaction with spruce basal area percentage as the most important drivers of tree-level beetle infestation. The number, basal area and proportions of beetle-infested spruce were lower in treated stands at sites where treatments significantly reduced the abundance of large spruce trees and where the abundance of large spruce was relatively high prior to tree removal. However, spruce density reduction did not result in a reduction of infestation rates in the remaining large ({$>$}25. cm DBH) spruce during the ongoing beetle outbreak. While confirming previous assessments on the limited effectiveness of density reduction treatments for mitigating stand-level beetle infestation, this study provides further insights on the stand structural controls that mediate forest management effects on beetle disturbance dynamics. We conclude by suggesting that priority should be given to management practices that enhance resilience by increasing spruce advance regeneration in the understory as opposed to treatments aimed at achieving resistance to beetle disturbance.},

To mitigate the impact of human activities, environmental policies are developed and implemented, but their effects are commonly not well understood because of the lack of tools to predict the effects of conservation policies on habitat quality and/or diversity. We present a straightforward model for the simultaneous assessment of terrestrial and aquatic habitat quality in river basins as a function of land use and anthropogenic threats to habitat that could be applied under different management scenarios to help understand the trade-offs of conservation actions. We modify the InVEST model for the assessment of terrestrial habitat quality and extend it to freshwater habitats. We assess the reliability of the model in a severely impaired basin by comparing modeled results to observed terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity data. Estimated habitat quality is significantly correlated with observed terrestrial vascular plant richness (R2=0.76) and diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates (R2=0.34), as well as with ecosystem functions such as in-stream phosphorus retention (R2=0.45). After that, we analyze different scenarios to assess the suitability of the model to inform changes in habitat quality under different conservation strategies. We believe that the developed model can be useful to assess potential levels of biodiversity, and to support conservation planning given its capacity to forecast the effects of management actions in river basins.},

Many eCO2 experiments suggest that nutrient limitations modulate the local magnitude of the eCO2 effect on plant biomass1,3,5, but the global extent of these limitations has not been empirically quantified, complicating projections of the capacity of plants to take up CO27,8. Here, we present a data-driven global quantification of the eCO2 effect on biomass based on 138 eCO2 experiments. The strength of CO2 fertilization is primarily driven by nitrogen (N) in {\textasciitilde}65\% of global vegetation and by phosphorus (P) in {\textasciitilde}25\% of global vegetation, with N- or P-limitation modulated by mycorrhizal association. Our approach suggests that CO2 levels expected by 2100 can potentially enhance plant biomass by 12 {\textpm} 3\% above current values, equivalent to 59 {\textpm} 13 PgC. The global-scale response to eCO2 we derive from experiments is similar to past changes in greenness9 and biomass10 with rising CO2, suggesting that CO2 will continue to stimulate plant biomass in the future despite the constraining effect of soil nutrients. Our research reconciles conflicting evidence on CO2 fertilization across scales and provides an empirical estimate of the biomass sensitivity to eCO2 that may help to constrain climate projections.},

This paper investigates C and N concentrations in fine roots in relation to different stand characteristics resulting from conversion of coppiced forests to high forests. In order to evaluate possible interferences due to different vegetative stages of vegetation, fine-root sampling was repeated six times in each stand during the same 2008 growing season. Fine-root sampling was conducted within three different soil depths (0-10; 10-20; and 20-30 cm). Fine-root traits were measured by means of WinRHIZO software which enable us to separate them into three different diameter classes (0-0.5, 0.5-1.0 and 1.0-2.0 mm). The data collected indicate that N concentration was higher in converted stands than in the coppiced stand whereas C concentration was higher in the coppiced stand than in converted stands. Consequently the fine-root C:N ratio was significantly higher in coppiced than in converted stands and showed an inverse relationship with fine-root turnover rate, confirming a significant change of fine-root status after the conversion of a coppice to high forest. {\copyright} 2013 Terzaghi, Montagnoli, Di Iorio, Scippa and Chiatante.},

It is projected that the global land area experiencing heat waves will double by 2020, and quadruple by 2040. Extreme heat events can impact a wide variety of tree functions. At the leaf level, photosynthesis is reduced, photooxidative stress increases, leaves abscise and the growth rate of remaining leaves decreases. In some species, stomatal conductance increases at high temperatures, which may be a mechanism for leaf cooling. At the whole plant level, heat stress can decrease growth and shift biomass allocation. When drought stress accompanies heat waves, the negative effects of heat stress are exacerbated and can lead to tree mortality. However, some species exhibit remarkable tolerance to thermal stress. Responses include changes that minimize stress on photosynthesis and reductions in dark respiration. Although there have been few studies to date, there is evidence of within-species genetic variation in thermal tolerance, which could be important to exploit in production forestry systems. Understanding the mechanisms of differing tree responses to extreme temperature events may be critically important for understanding how tree species will be affected by climate change.},

Whereas studies based on closure of the water balance suggest higher evapotranspiration over forests, studies based on turbulent exchange and/or energy balance closure suggest generally higher latent heat flux over non-forest sites. In this study, this forest evapotranspiration paradox was investigated using data from four long-term lysimeter stations in western Europe with contrasting land cover conditions. The results were consistent with evapotranspiration estimates from catchment-scale water balance studies rather than with eddy covariance estimates. They were also found to be largely consistent with a model previously proposed to predict forest cover effects on evapotranspiration. The results of this study suggest that eddy covariance data should be treated with care when used to assess long-term average water balance impacts of land use.},

  abstract = {The rates of anthropogenic climate change substantially exceed those at which forest ecosystems -- dominated by immobile, long-lived organisms -- are able to adapt. The resulting maladaptation of forests has potentially detrimental effects on ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, as many forest-dwelling species are highly dependent on the prevailing tree species, a delayed response of the latter to a changing climate can contribute to an extinction debt and mask climate-induced biodiversity loss. However, climate change will likely also intensify forest disturbances. Here, we tested the hypothesis that disturbances foster the reorganization of ecosystems and catalyze the adaptation of forest composition to climate change. Our specific objectives were (i) to quantify the rate of autonomous forest adaptation to climate change, (ii) examine the role of disturbance in the adaptation process, and (iii) investigate spatial differences in climate-induced species turnover in an unmanaged mountain forest landscape (Kalkalpen National Park, Austria). Simulations with a process-based forest landscape model were performed for 36 unique combinations of climate and disturbance scenarios over 1000~years. We found that climate change strongly favored European beech and oak species (currently prevailing in mid- to low-elevation areas), with novel species associations emerging on the landscape. Yet, it took between 357 and 706~years before the landscape attained a dynamic equilibrium with the climate system. Disturbances generally catalyzed adaptation and decreased the time needed to attain equilibrium by up to 211~years. However, while increasing disturbance frequency and severity accelerated adaptation, increasing disturbance size had the opposite effect. Spatial analyses suggest that particularly the lowest and highest elevation areas will be hotspots of future species change. We conclude that the growing maladaptation of forests to climate and the long lead times of autonomous adaptation need to be considered more explicitly in the ongoing efforts to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem services provisioning.},

  abstract = {Droughts have intensified in Central Europe and will likely become a major driver of forest ecosystem change in the future. Regional studies are needed to understand drought impacts on forests and to provide guidance for adaptive management. In this study, we have investigated the effects of an extraordinary drought period in 2018 -- 2020 on tree growth in the State of Bavaria (Germany). We (i) assessed overall changes in tree growth compared to pre-drought conditions, (ii) mapped the spatial configuration of drought and its impact on growth across ecoregions, (iii) quantified the standardized drought effect for the most abundant tree species, and (iv) analyzed the inter- and intraspecific variability in growth responses to drought. Covering a large environmental gradient, we compared 3,462 tree basal area growth records at 200 inventory plots with the pre-drought period of 2006 -- 2017. We analyzed drought impacts on tree growth using nonparametric randomization tests and linear quantile mixed models (LQMMs). Median annual tree growth declined by 41.3\% during drought. Decreases in growth were statistically significant for 13 out of 20 species. Growth reductions were most distinct in northwestern ecoregions of Bavaria. After controlling for other covariates of tree growth, the most abundant conifers, Picea abies [Karst.] and Pinus sylvestris [L.], were overall more susceptible than the common broadleaves, Fagus sylvatica [L.], Quercus robur [L.], and Quercus petraea [Matt.]. Yet, all species exhibited a high intraspecific variation in drought response. Altering tree species composition is a key strategy to adapt forest ecosystems. Our study reveals high potential to mitigate future drought impacts by admixing P. abies- and P. sylvestris-dominated forests with more drought-adapted broadleaved tree species. In addition, the high intraspecific variability in drought susceptibility indicates potential to promote provenances or individuals with low drought sensitivity to reduce the local loss of tree species.},

At five sites located in southeastern Germany, we conducted three censuses of tree regeneration after implementing two different canopy disturbances (aggregated and distributed canopy openings), and four deadwood treatments (retaining downed, standing, downed + standing deadwood and removing all deadwood), as well as in one untreated control plot. In addition, we measured understory light levels and recorded local air temperature and humidity over five years. We (i) tested the effects of experimental disturbance and deadwood treatments on regeneration and (ii) identified the drivers of regeneration density as well as seedling species and structural diversity. Regeneration density increased over time. Aggregated canopy openings supported species and structural diversity, but reduced regeneration density. Tree regeneration was positively associated with understory light levels, while maximum vapor pressure deficit influenced tree regeneration negatively. Deadwood and browsing impacts on regeneration varied and were inconclusive. Our study indicates that despite the drought episode regeneration in beech-dominated forests persisted under moderately disturbed canopies. However, the positive effect of increased light availability on tree regeneration might have been offset by harsher microclimate after canopies have been disturbed.},

  abstract = {Against the background of the ongoing climate change, forest science and Central-European forest management need information about tree species that are suitable of forming resistant and resilient multispecific and multipurpose forest stands. Non-native species are also considered for this purpose. One of these species may be the Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), which has been introduced from western North America to Europe in the 19th century. The aim of this review is to compile recent scientific results that are relevant in the context of the use of the Douglas fir in future Central-European forestry to create a foundation for science-based decision-making, and to formulate future research tasks on that basis. Due to its high growth rates and low susceptibility to needle cast fungi, the Douglas fir's coastal variety (P. menziesii var. menziesii, syn.: var. viridis) is being preferred in Central-European silviculture. It is competitively superior to all indigenous Central-European forest tree species due to rapid height growth and efficient shading of competing plants; high drought tolerance, water use efficiency and resilience after drought stress; and efficient water and nutrient uptake and high nutrient use efficiency. In Central Europe, the Douglas fir is currently less threatened by pests and pathogens than are the indigenous Norway spruce and Scots pine. Its litter is better decomposable compared to native conifers, but increased nitrification, especially at sites with former agricultural use or under anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, or lower nitrate uptake rates due to lower nitrogen demand of the species can result in enhanced soil acidification, aluminum mobilization and leaching of nitrate, ``base'' cations and aluminum compounds. Mixtures of Douglas fir and native trees may be particularly effective in sequestrating carbon and nitrogen in the soil. Negative effects of the Douglas fir on the plant diversity of a given community seem to be small or even non-existent, but its interactions with the fauna is more ambiguous. The majority of nature conservation organizations recommend avoiding Douglas-fir monocultures and restricting the fraction of Douglas-fir admixtures to stands of native tree species to 30\% at maximum in considering current regulations for nature protection. Future research tasks comprise monitoring of the Douglas-fir provenances in cultivation and of introduced pests and pathogens, investigations of responses to consecutive and combined stress factors and of the species' invasiveness at dry sites as well as comparative long-term studies on interactions with animal communities and on matter flux and turnover in the ecosystems.},

The length of the fire season is used to estimate the fractional area of a grid cell which is burnt in a given year. This affected area is converted into an average fire return interval which can be compared to observations. 3 When driven by observed climate for the 20th century (at a 0.5{$^\circ$} longitude/latitude resolution), the model yielded fire return intervals in good agreement with observations for many regions (except parts of semiarid Africa and boreal Siberia). We suggest that further improvement for these regions must involve additional process descriptions such as permafrost and fuel/fire dynamics.},

  abstract = {Climate change has already triggered species distribution shifts in many parts of the world. Increasing impacts are expected for the future, yet few studies have aimed for a general understanding of the regional basis for species vulnerability. We projected late 21st century distributions for 1,350 European plants species under seven climate change scenarios. Application of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List criteria to our projections shows that many European plant species could become severely threatened. More than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080. Expected species loss and turnover per pixel proved to be highly variable across scenarios (27-42\% and 45-63\% respectively, averaged over Europe) and across regions (2.5-86\% and 17-86\%, averaged over scenarios). Modeled species loss and turnover were found to depend strongly on the degree of change in just two climate variables describing temperature and moisture conditions. Despite the coarse scale of the analysis, species from mountains could be seen to be disproportionably sensitive to climate change ({$\approx$}60\% species loss). The boreal region was projected to lose few species, although gaining many others from immigration. The greatest changes are expected in the transition between the Mediterranean and Euro-Siberian regions. We found that risks of extinction for European plants may be large, even in moderate scenarios of climate change and despite inter-model variability. {\copyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O), like carbon dioxide, is a long-lived greenhouse gas that accumulates in the atmosphere. Over the past 150 years, increasing atmospheric N2O concentrations have contributed to stratospheric ozone depletion1 and climate change2, with the current rate of increase estimated at 2 per cent per decade. Existing national inventories do not provide a full picture of N2O emissions, owing to their omission of natural sources and limitations in methodology for attributing anthropogenic sources. Here we present a global N2O inventory that incorporates both natural and anthropogenic sources and accounts for the interaction between nitrogen additions and the biochemical processes that control N2O emissions. We use bottom-up (inventory, statistical extrapolation of flux measurements, process-based land and ocean modelling) and top-down (atmospheric inversion) approaches to provide a comprehensive quantification of global N2O sources and sinks resulting from 21 natural and human sectors between 1980 and 2016. Global N2O emissions were 17.0 (minimum--maximum estimates: 12.2--23.5) teragrams of nitrogen per year (bottom-up) and 16.9 (15.9--17.7) teragrams of nitrogen per year (top-down) between 2007 and 2016. Global human-induced emissions, which are dominated by nitrogen additions to croplands, increased by 30\% over the past four decades to 7.3 (4.2--11.4) teragrams of nitrogen per year. This increase was mainly responsible for the growth in the atmospheric burden. Our findings point to growing N2O emissions in emerging economies---particularly Brazil, China and India. Analysis of process-based model estimates reveals an emerging N2O--climate feedback resulting from interactions between nitrogen additions and climate change. The recent growth in N2O emissions exceeds some of the highest projected emission scenarios3,4, underscoring the urgency to mitigate N2O emissions.},

  abstract = {Currently, the decline in spruce wood prices is a serious problem for the forestry sector in the Czech Republic. We estimate that the fall in wood prices in European markets causes losses not only to the forestry companies producing, harvesting, and processing the wood, but also to the workers in the sector. These losses are mainly caused by a combination of several natural factors: drought, climate change, and the effects of bark beetles. In particular, spruce bark beetles cause the greatest damage. Due to this bark beetle calamity, unplanned logging has increased. In 2019, these damages have culminated. Almost 100 million m3 of wood has been harvested over the last decade due to the bark beetle and more than half of this volume has been mined in the last four years. Therefore, the losses in the forestry sector are around EUR 1.12 billion. The aim of this study is an analysis of the relationship between the volume of incidental logging and the decline in the price of spruce wood. These results show the strong correlation between the measure of unplanned wood harvesting and the decrease in wood prices, as well as an estimate of price development if the upward trend of incidental mining continues. The average price of wood in the Czech Republic could thus reach a historical minimum of EUR 79.39 per m3 of spruce and category SM/JE II (spruce/fir). In addition, the decline in wood prices will be reflected in the management of forestry and timber businesses, including stagnant wages for forestry workers. The socio-economic impact of the bark beetle calamity is high and is most affected by the decline in spruce timber prices.},

However, the carbon footprints and land use of organic diets, and how they compare to conventional diets, have not yet been quantified. Using food consumption data from the German National Nutrition Survey II, and carbon footprint and land-use data from life cycle assessment studies of conventional and organic food products, carbon footprints and land use of conventional and organic diets in Germany were calculated for three consumer categories: men, women and their combined unweighted average. Conventional diets are defined as the average diet of consumers who do not buy organic food products; organic diets are the average diets of consumers whose food purchases include a large share of organic food products. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with land use change are not included. The carbon footprints of the average conventional and organic diets are essentially equal (ca. 1250 CO2-eq cap-1 year-1), while the land use to provide food is ca. 40\% greater in the organic diet (ca. 1900 and 2750 m2 of land cap-1 year-1 in the conventional and organic diets, respectively). The average conventional diet contains 45\% more meat than the average organic diet, which on the other hand contains 40\% more vegetables, fruits, and legumes (combined). Animal-based food products dominate the carbon footprints and land use (ca. 70--75\%) in both diets. The organic diet, in particular that of women, is more aligned with health-based dietary guidelines. Diet-related carbon footprints and land use can be reduced by shifting toward diets with less animal-based food products (other measures are also discussed). General conclusions about the overall performance of conventional and organic agriculture are not supported by this study since only carbon footprints and land use were assessed, while other important issues, such as biodiversity, ecotoxicity impacts and animal welfare, were not considered.},

It is well established that tree physiology is important in understanding drought-driven mortality; however, the accuracy of predictions based on physiology alone has been limited. We propose that complicating factors at two levels stymie predictions of drought-driven mortality: (i) organismal-level physiological and site factors that obscure understanding of drought exposure and vulnerability and (ii) community-level ecological interactions, particularly with biotic agents whose effects on tree mortality may reverse expectations based on stress physiology. We conclude with a path forward that emphasizes the need for an integrative approach to stress physiology and biotic agent dynamics when assessing forest risk to drought-driven morality in a changing climate.},

  abstract = {The frequency of heatwaves, droughts and their co-occurrence vary greatly in simulations of different climate models. Since these extremes are expected to become more frequent with climate change, it is important to understand how vegetation models respond to different climatologies in heatwave and drought occurrence. In previous work, six climate scenarios featuring different drought-heat signatures have been developed to investigate how single versus compound extremes affect vegetation and carbon dynamics. Here, we use these scenarios to force six dynamic global vegetation models to investigate model agreement in vegetation and carbon cycle response to these scenarios. We find that global responses to different drought-heat signatures vary considerably across models. Models agree that frequent compound hot-dry events lead to a reduction in tree cover and vegetation carbon stocks. However, models show opposite responses in vegetation changes for the scenario with no extremes. We find a strong relationship between the frequency of concurrent hot-dry conditions and the total carbon pool, suggesting a reduction of the natural land carbon sink for increasing occurrence of hot-dry events. The effect of frequent compound hot and dry extremes is larger than the sum of the effects when only one extreme occurs, highlighting the importance of studying compound events. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the representation of compound hot-dry event occurrence in climate models propagate to uncertainties in the simulation of vegetation distribution and carbon pools. Therefore, to reduce uncertainties in future carbon cycle projections, the representation of compound events in climate models needs to be improved.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Pinus halepensis is a Mediterranean tree species occupying areas of high tourist interest, where it forms aesthetic and recreational forests. However, intense human pressure, adverse climatic conditions and overgrazing degrade Aleppo pine forest ecosystems and render the natural regeneration of this species difficult. The ecological, landscape, recreational and soil conservation uses of P. halepensis along with its aesthetic value, make this species important for landscape planning and multi-purpose forestry. For these reasons, artificial regeneration may be required in order to render ecosystem restoration faster. Although P. halepensis is characterized by a high germination capacity and a constant temperature of 20 {$^\circ$}C is considered optimal for germination, no research has dealt with the germination behaviour and early growth of seedlings under alternative temperature conditions similar to those dominating outdoors. Moreover, little research was conducted on seed quality characteristics of this species. Thus, in this study seed quality of P. halepensis was estimated by measuring purity, number of seeds per kg, weight of 1000 seeds, average seed weight, seed moisture content and percentage of empty seeds. Also, seed germination capacity, germination rate, percentage of infected and not germinated viable seeds, abnormal seedlings as well as the total seedling length were studied under laboratory (alternative temperature) and chamber (constant temperature) conditions with the same photoperiod. Results showed that the percentage of empty seeds and abnormal seedlings was extremely low and the total germination percentage was very high (87--90\%) in both environments. Germination capacity, germination rate and the total length of seedlings did not show any differences among the two growth environments.},

Simple random maps, maps with contagion (i.e., clusters of the same land cover type), and actual landscape data from USGS land use (LUDA) data maps were used in the analyses. Landscape patterns were compared using indices measuring diversity (I!/), dominance (0) and contagion (C). Rare land cover types were lost as grain became coarser. This loss could be predicted analytically for random maps with two land cover types, and it was observed in actual landscapes as grain was increased experimentally. However, the rate of loss was influenced by the spatial pattern. Land cover types that were clumped disappeared slowly or were retained with increasing grain, whereas cover types that were dispersed were lost rapidly. The diversity index decreased linearly with increasing grain size, but dominance and contagion did not show a linear relationship. The indices D and C increased with increasing extent, but Hexhibited a variable response. The indices were sensitive to the number (m) of cover types observed in the data set and the fraction of the landscape occupied by each cover type (P,); both m and Pk varied with grain and extent. Qualitative and quantitative changes in measurements across spatial scales will differ depending on how scale is defined. Characterizing the relationships between ecological measurements and the grain or extent of the data may make it possible to predict or correct for the loss of information with changes in spatial scale.},

In this study, a georeferenced database at the 1-km spatial resolution was developed to initialize and drive a process-based model (Forest-BGC) of water and carbon balance over a gridded 54976 km2 area covering two river basins in mountainous western Oregon. Corresponding data sets were also prepared at 10-km and 50-km spatial resolutions using commonly employed aggregation schemes. Estimates were made at each grid cell for climate variables including daily solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, and precipitation. The topographic structure, water holding capacity, vegetation type and leaf area index were likewise estimated for initial conditions. The daily time series for the climatic drivers was developed from interpolations of meteorological station data for the water year 1990 (1 October 1989-30 September 1990). Model outputs at the 1-km resolution showed good agreement with observed patterns in runoff and productivity. The ranges for model inputs at the 10-km and 50-kin resolutions tended to contract because of the smoothed topography. Estimates for mean evapotranspiration and runoff were relatively insensitive to changing the spatial resolution of the grid whereas estimates of mean annual net primary production varied by 11\%. The designation of a vegetation type and leaf area at the 50-km resolution often subsumed significant heterogeneity in vegetation, and this factor accounted for much of the difference in the mean values for the carbon flux variables. Although area-wide means for model outputs were generally similar across resolutions, difference maps often revealed large areas of disagreement. Relatively high spatial resolution analyses of biogeochemical cycling are desirable from several perspectives and may be particularly important in the study of the potential impacts of climate change.},

It includes the evaluation of multiple criteria such as the production of timber and non-timber forest products and tangible as well as intangible values of ecosystem services (ES). Hence, it is beneficial compared to those methods that take a purely financial perspective. Accordingly, MCDA methods are increasingly popular in the wide field of sustainability assessment. Hybrid approaches allow aggregating MCDA and, potentially, other decision-making techniques to make use of their individual benefits and leading to a more holistic view of the actual consequences that come with certain decisions. This review is providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid approaches that are used in forest management planning. Today, the scientific world is facing increasing challenges regarding the evaluation of ES and the trade-offs between them, for example between provisioning and regulating services. As the preferences of multiple stakeholders are essential to improve the decision process in multi-purpose forestry, participatory and hybrid approaches turn out to be of particular importance. Accordingly, hybrid methods show great potential for becoming most relevant in future decision making. Based on the review presented here, the development of models for the use in planning processes should focus on participatory modeling and the consideration of uncertainty regarding available information.},

Forest experts were asked to score the six most important ES indicators and biodiversity for forest stands with either exotic or native tree species. Average scores and their variation were used to form an optimal forest portfolio (proportions of the five stand types). Quantitative indicators of ES were used to calculate the reference portfolio. Portfolios based on expert opinions (49\% Eucalyptus plus Pinus, 51\% native Nothofagus and mixed Pseudotsuga) did not differ significantly from portfolios based on quantitative indicators (51\% Eucalyptus plus Pinus, 49\% Nothofagus, mixed Pseudotsuga and Acacia). Both portfolios offer good protection against low achievement levels and prevent the degradation of important ES and biodiversity, while pure stands showed low achievement levels for specific ES. We conclude that integrating expert knowledge into forest planning may well support considering ES and biodiversity. Forest owners in the Mediterranean region of Chile should be encouraged to integrate native Nothofagus species into their forest portfolios to better provide for multiple ES and the conservation of biodiversity.},

Conventionally, the impacts of the historical cropland expansion on Earth's radiation balance have been quantified through two opposing effects: the release of stored carbon to the atmosphere as CO2 (warming) versus the increase in surface albedo (cooling)1. Changing forest cover has a third effect on the global radiation balance by altering emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that control the loadings of multiple warming and cooling climate pollutants: tropospheric ozone (O3), methane (CH4) and aerosols. Although human land cover change has dominated BVOC emission variability over the past century2-4, the net effect on global climate has not been quantified. Here, I show that the effects of the global cropland expansion between the 1850s and 2000s on BVOC emissions and atmospheric chemistry have imposed an additional net global radiative impact of -0.11 {\textpm} 0.17Wm-2 (cooling). This magnitude is comparable to that of the surface albedo and land carbon release effects. I conclude that atmospheric chemistry must be considered in climate impact assessments of anthropogenic land cover change and in forestry for climate protection strategies.},

As such, it charts a new course in the global climate effort. The Paris Agreement's central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. To reach these ambitious goals, appropriate financial flows, a new technology framework and an enhanced capacity building framework will be put in place, thus supporting action by developing countries and the most vulnerable countries, in line with their own national objectives. The Agreement also provides for enhanced transparency of action and support through a more robust transparency framework.},

Thus, assessing tree vulnerability to drought is crucial to improve prediction of forest mortality and species range limits. We quantified the abundance of two oak species (Quercus robur and Quercus ilex) along a water stress gradient in a coastal forest located at the southern edge of the distribution of Q. robur. We assessed their ecophysiological responses to drought during a wet and a dry year and determined their vulnerability to drought under field conditions. The abundance of Q. ilex was high all along the water stress gradient, whereas the abundance of Q. robur dramatically declined with decreasing water availability. During dry years, the level of native embolism was significantly higher for Q. robur than for Q. ilex due to species differences in vulnerability to xylem cavitation. Q. robur had a narrower hydraulic safety margin than Q. ilex and operated very close to the species threshold of hydraulic failure, making it highly vulnerable to drought-induced mortality. In the current context of increasing drought frequency and severity, survival of Q. robur populations will be threatened at warm range margins.},

In Italy, beech covers one million hectares, half of which originated by coppicing. This study tested which factors drive the presence and growth of beech resprouts, with a focus on fertility, cutting intensity, age, and size at time of coppicing. We analyzed 509 stools in 24 stands coppiced between 1 and 26 years before sampling. We fitted Generalized Linear Mixed Models of the probability of sprouting and height of the tallest resprout for each stool as a function of elevation, slope, aspect, bedrock, precipitation, temperature, age at coppicing, time since coppicing, residual shoot density, the sum, average and coefficient of variation of the diameter of cut shoots, and type of stool treatment. Of all harvested stools, 249 (49\%) had sprouted with an average of 7.6 resprouts per stool. Height of the tallest resprout on each stool ranged from 3 to 800 cm, mainly as a function of time since coppicing. Resprout mortality was on average 1.4\% per plot. Sprouting decreased with decreasing site fertility, increasing precipitation, and increasing size of cut stems. Leaving one or more shoots on the stool after felling produced a high proportion of sprouting stools (82\%). Although based on a limited sample, our quantitative analysis of the driving factors of sprouting in beech can be used to support silvicultural decisions in over-mature beech coppices, and to optimize trade-offs between ecosystem services such as biomass production, biodiversity, and hydro-geologic protection.},

They exemplify cutting-edge themes such as forest ecology in warmer climates, consequences of heavy land use, and resilience at the trailing edge of the distribution of many European forest species (Silver fir, Norway spruce, Beech, Black pine, Birch). We introduce the setting under the geological and climatological point of view and review the literature on the interactions between these long-term drivers and the specific, structural, and genetic diversity of these forest communities (e.g., effects of glacial refugia or tectonic/volcanic activity), followed by a brief outline of what little is known about natural disturbance regimes and their range of variability. Anthropogenic disturbances (fire, grazing) and land use changes (abandonment of cropland and pasture) have been by far the main drivers of forest dynamics at least for the last two millennia, determining for examples overageing of coppices, treeline advances, forest encroachment on former agricultural land. We suggest considerations about the interplay between these land use changes and disturbance drivers (e.g. fuel continuity), summarize comparisons between managed and unmanaged forests (e.g., increase in tree size, deadwood, biodiversity indicators), and elaborate on current proposals for climate-adapted management, highlighting specific and genetic diversity as an important source of resilience and adaptive potential.},

  abstract = {Drought as an intermittent disturbance of the water cycle interacts with the carbon cycle differently than the 'gradual' climate change. During drought plants respond physiologically and structurally to prevent excessive water loss according to species-specific water use strategies. This has consequences for carbon uptake by photosynthesis and release by total ecosystem respiration. After a drought the disturbances in the reservoirs of moisture, organic matter and nutrients in the soil and carbohydrates in plants lead to longer-term effects in plant carbon cycling, and potentially mortality. Direct and carry-over effects, mortality and consequently species competition in response to drought are strongly related to the survival strategies of species. Here we review the state of the art of the understanding of the relation between soil moisture drought and the interactions with the carbon cycle of the terrestrial ecosystems. We argue that plant strategies must be given an adequate role in global vegetation models if the effects of drought on the carbon cycle are to be described in a way that justifies the interacting processes. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Three consecutive dry summers in western Europe (2018--2019--2020) had widespread negative impacts on society and ecosystems, and started societal debate on (changing) drought vulnerability and adaptation measures. We investigate the occurrence of multi-year droughts in the Rhine basin, with a focus on event probability in the present and in future warmer climates. Additionally, we investigate the temporally compounding physical drivers of multi-year drought events. A combination of multiple reanalysis datasets and multi-model large ensemble climate model simulations was used to provide a robust analysis of the statistics and physical processes of these rare events. We identify two types of multi-year drought events (consecutive meteorological summer droughts and long-duration hydrological droughts), and show that these occur on average about twice in a 30~year period in the present climate, though natural variability is large (zero to five events can occur in a single 30~year period). Projected decreases in summer precipitation and increases in atmospheric evaporative demand, lead to a doubling of event probability at 1~{$\circ$}C additional global warming relative to present-day and an increase in the average length of events. Consecutive meteorological summer droughts are forced by two, seemingly independent, summers of lower than normal precipitation and higher than normal evaporative demand. The soil moisture response to this temporally compound meteorological forcing has a clear multi-year imprint, resulting in a relatively~larger reduction of soil moisture content in the second year of drought, and potentially more severe drought impacts. Long-duration hydrological droughts start with a severe summer drought followed by lingering meteorologically dry conditions. This limits and slows down the hydrological recovery of soil moisture content, leading to long-lasting drought conditions. This initial exploration provides avenues for further investigation of multi-year drought hazard and vulnerability in the region, which is advised given the projected trends and vulnerability of society and ecosystems.},

Agricultural abandonment is an important land use process in many world regions and one of the dominant land use change processes in Europe. Previous studies have shown that abandonment can have both positive and negative effects on several environmental processes, influenced by location and scale. Preferred policies and management of these areas are debated given concerns for the loss of (traditional) agricultural landscapes and potential impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. We present a European-scale impact assessment of the possible effects of agricultural abandonment, based on eight indicators that are on the forefront of the agricultural abandonment debate. Using a multi-scale modelling approach, we expect between 71.277 and 211.814 km2 of agricultural abandonment in 2040. Impacts on the indicators and trade-offs between the impacts are spatially variable. A typology of typical trade-off bundles at a 1 km2 resolution resulted in four typical trade-off clusters. All clusters identified are characterized by a loss of agriculture-related values, such as agro-biodiversity and cultural heritage. For two clusters, this was accompanied by positive effects on indicators such as carbon sequestration, nature recreation and mammal habitat suitability. Overall, our results indicate that location and scale are key to assess the trade-offs originating from agricultural abandonment in Europe. Identification of typical trade-offs bundles can help to distinguish potential desirable outcomes of agricultural abandonment and assist in targeting measures to areas that face similar management challenges.},

In doing so, we study the costs of monitoring, measuring, and contracting; the principal-agent problem; and questions related to life cycle analyses of CO2.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The carbon balance of vegetation is dominated by the two large fluxes of photosynthesis (P) and respiration (R). Mechanistic models have attempted to simulate the two fluxes separately, each with their own set of internal and external controls. This has led to model predictions where environmental change causes R to exceed P, with consequent dieback of vegetation. However, empirical evidence suggests that the R : P ratio is constrained to a narrow range of about 0.4-0.5. Physiological explanations for the narrow range are not conclusive. The aim of this work is to introduce a novel perspective by theoretical study of the quantitative relationship between the four carbon fluxes of P, R, growth and storage (or its inverse, remobilization). METHODS: Starting from the law of conservation of mass - in this case carbon - equations are derived for the relative magnitudes of all carbon fluxes, which depend on only two parameters: the R : P ratio and the relative rate of storage of carbon in remobilizable reserves. The equations are used to explain observed flux ratios and to analyse incomplete data sets of carbon fluxes. KEY RESULTS: The storage rate is shown to be a freely varying parameter, whereas R : P is narrowly constrained. This explains the constancy of the ratio reported in the literature. With the information thus gained, a data set of R and P in grassland was analysed, and flux estimates could be derived for the periods after cuts in which plant growth is dominated by remobilization before photosynthesis takes over. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the relative magnitudes of photosynthesis, respiration, growth and substrate storage are indeed tightly constrained, but because of mass conservation rather than for physiological reasons. This facilitates analysis of incomplete data sets. Mechanistic models, as the embodiment of physiological mechanisms, need to show consistency with the constraints.},

  abstract = {On the basis of the IPCC B2, A1b and B1 baseline scenarios, mitigation scenarios were developed that stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at 650, 550 and 450 and - subject to specific assumptions - 400 ppm CO2-eq. The analysis takes into account a large number of reduction options, such as reductions of non-CO2 gases, carbon plantations and measures in the energy system. The study shows stabilization as low as 450 ppm CO 2-eq. to be technically feasible, even given relatively high baseline scenarios. To achieve these lower concentration levels, global emissions need to peak within the first two decades. The net present value of abatement costs for the B2 baseline scenario (a medium scenario) increases from 0.2\% of cumulative GDP to 1.1\% as the shift is made from 650 to 450 ppm. On the other hand, the probability of meeting a two-degree target increases from 0\%-10\% to 20\%-70\%. The mitigation scenarios lead to lower emissions of regional air pollutants but also to increased land use. The uncertainty in the cost estimates is at least in the order of 50\%, with the most important uncertainties including land-use emissions, the potential for bio-energy and the contribution of energy efficiency. Furthermore, creating the right socio-economic and political conditions for mitigation is more important than any of the technical constraints. {\copyright} 2007 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {Fires, among other forms of natural and anthropogenic disturbance, play a central role in regulating the location, composition and biomass of forests. Understanding the role of fire in global forest loss is crucial in constraining land-use change emissions and the global carbon cycle. We analysed the relationship between forest loss and fire at 500 m resolution based on satellite-derived data for the 2003--2018 period. Satellite fire data included burned area and active fire detections, to best account for large and small fires, respectively. We found that, on average, 38 {\textpm} 9\% ({\textpm} range) of global forest loss was associated with fire, and this fraction remained relatively stable throughout the study period. However, the fraction of fire-related forest loss varied substantially on a regional basis, and showed statistically significant trends in key tropical forest areas. Decreases in the fraction of fire-related forest loss were found where deforestation peaked early in our study period, including the Amazon and Indonesia while increases were found for tropical forests in Africa. The inclusion of active fire detections accounted for 41\%, on average, of the total fire-related forest loss, with larger contributions in small clearings in interior tropical forests and human-dominated landscapes. Comparison to higher-resolution fire data with resolutions of 375 and 20 m indicated that commission errors due to coarse resolution fire data largely balanced out omission errors due to missed small fire detections for regional to continental-scale estimates of fire-related forest loss. Besides an improved understanding of forest dynamics, these findings may help to refine and separate fire-related and non-fire-related land-use change emissions in forested ecosystems.},

  abstract = {A wealth of remotely sensed image time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes ({$>$} 0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01-0.07 {$\sigma$}) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1-0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur. Crown Copyright {\copyright} 2009.},

  abstract = {A challenge in phenology studies is understanding what constitutes phenological change amidst background variation. The majority of phenological studies have focused on extracting critical points in the seasonal growth cycle, without exploiting the full temporal detail. The high degree of phenological variability between years demonstrates the necessity of distinguishing long-term phenological change from temporal variability. Here, we demonstrate the phenological change detection ability of a method for detecting change within time series. BFAST, Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend, integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day NDVI time series with varying amounts of seasonal amplitude and noise, containing abrupt disturbances (e.g. fires) and long-term phenological changes. This revealed that the method is able to detect the timing of phenological changes within time series while accounting for abrupt disturbances and noise. Results showed that the phenological change detection is influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio of the time series. Between different land cover types the seasonal amplitude varies and determines the signal-to-noise ratio, and as such the capacity to differentiate phenological changes from noise. Application of the method on 16-day NDVI MODIS images from 2000 until 2009 for a forested study area in south eastern Australia confirmed these results. It was shown that a minimum seasonal amplitude of 0.1 NDVI is required to detect phenological change within cleaned MODIS NDVI time series using the quality flags. BFAST identifies phenological change independent of phenological metrics by exploiting the full time series. The method is globally applicable since it analyzes each pixel individually without the setting of thresholds to detect change within a time series. Long-term phenological changes can be detected within NDVI time series of a large range of land cover types (e.g. grassland, woodlands and deciduous forests) having a seasonal amplitude larger than the noise level. The method can be applied to any time series data and it is not necessarily limited to NDVI. {\copyright} 2010.},

The optimised parameterisation enables the models to realistically simulate carbon and water fluxes measured at several fluxtower sites across the region, as well as several satellite data products. Using these models, we then studied how climatic factors and soil texture may influence the functioning of dryland ecosystems.

This study aimed to assess to what extent forests are currently protected and how felling restrictions affect the potential annual wood supply within 27 European Union member states, Norway, and Switzerland and to discuss trade-offs between intensified use of forest biomass and forest protection efforts. Protected forests covered 33 million ha (20 \% of total forest area) in 2005, of which 16 million ha was protected for biodiversity and the remaining area for landscape diversity. Within the protected areas, on average 48 \% of the volume cannot be harvested in forests protected for biodiversity and 40 \% in forests protected for landscapes. Consequently, 73 million m3 (10 \% of the annual theoretical potential supply from the total forest area) of wood cannot be felled from the protected forests in Europe. Protected forests do not necessarily affect wood supply given the current demand for wood in Europe. However, if demand for wood from European forests for material and energy use significantly increases, the impact of existing protected forest networks may become significant after all. On the other hand, wood harvesting is allowed to a fair extent in many protected areas. Hence, the question could be raised whether biodiversity and landscape diversity within designated areas are sufficiently protected. Careful planning is required to accommodate both the protection of biological and landscape diversity and demand for wood, while not forgetting all other services that forests provide. {\copyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.},

So far there is a shortage of large-scale field yield data to support stakeholders. We investigated an operational-scale SRC plantation (POPFULL) with 12 poplar genotypes in Flanders during its first two biennial rotations. By inventorying shoot numbers and diameters, combined with allometric relationships, productivity related data were derived after each growing season. We observed significant variation in biomass yield and productivity-related characteristics among the 12 poplar genotypes, of which two recently selected. Genotype Hees (Populus deltoides {\texttimes} Populus nigra) and Skado (Populus trichocarpa {\texttimes} Populus maximowiczii, selected in 2005) reached the highest productivity among genotypes, i.e. 16Mgha-1y-1 of dry matter (DM) yield in the second rotation, which was more than double than the poorest performing genotype Brandaris (a pure P. nigra). However, with many small shoots genotype Hees had a different growth strategy than Skado that resprouted with few, thicker and higher shoots. Biomass production increased from a plantation average of 4.04Mgha-1y-1 of DM in the first (establishment) rotation to 12.24Mgha-1y-1 in the second rotation. Mean height growth raised from 2.08my-1 during the first rotation to 2.99my-1 during the second rotation. The influence of the first coppicing on tree mortality was negligible. Monitoring of subsequent rotations over the plantations' lifetime - which counts for SRC bioenergy cultures in general - is essential to evaluate productivity in the long term.},

Furthermore, since the development of growing stock and increment, and thus the patterns of net carbon exchange, are strongly affected by the age of the forest, information about the age structure is needed to understand the temporal variability of the greenhouse gas budgets and potential contributions of forest management (i.e. their additionality) to long-term removal of carbon from the atmosphere. European forests have changed drastically in recent decades, but to date no European level compilation of historical forest age structure data is available. In this study, country level historical age-class data was combined with a backcasting method to reconstruct the age-class structure for 25 European countries from 1950 to 2010 (total forest area in 2010: 118.3. million ha). Based on the results, dynamic maps of forest age-class distributions on 0.25{$^\circ$} {\texttimes} 0.25{$^\circ$} grid were generated, and the change in the forest age structure was analysed. Results show that the share of old forests ({$>$}100. years) has decreased from 26\% in 1950 to 17\% in 2010, and the mean age over the studied area decreased from 67 to 60. years. However, when looking at the change of the mean age from 1950 to 2010 at country level, there is a large variation between the countries. We discuss implications of the results and argue that the development of forest age structure contributed less than previously thought to the carbon sink in European forests from 1950 onwards. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Some of these are largely ecological changes, and all have important ecological consequences. Three of the well-documented global changes are: increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; alterations in the biogeochemistry of the global nitrogen cycle; and ongoing land use/land cover change. Human activity-now primarily fossil fuel combustion-has increased carbon dioxide concentrations from-280 to 355 uIL/L since 1800; the increase is unique, at least in the past 160 000 yr, and several lines of evidence demonstrate unequivocally that it is human-caused. This increase is likely to have climatic consequences-and certainly it has direct effects on biota in all Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. The global nitrogen cycle has been altered by human activity to such an extent that more nitrogen is fixed annually by humanity (primarily for nitrogen fertilizer, also by legume crops and as a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion) than by all natural pathways combined. This added nitrogen alters the chemistry of the atmosphere and of aquatic ecosystems, contributes to eutrophication of the biosphere, and has substantial regional This content downloaded by the authorized user from 192.168.52.75 on Sun, 2 Dec 2012 16:57:40 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions MACARTHUR AWARD LECTURE effects on biological diversity in the most affected areas. Finally, human land use/land cover change has transformed one-third to one-half of Earth's ice-free surface. This in and of itself probably represents the most important component of global change now and will for some decades to come; it has profound effects on biological diversity on land and on ecosystems downwind and downstream of affected areas. Overall, any clear dichotomy between pristine ecosystems and human-altered areas that may have existed in the past has vanished, and ecological research should account for this reality. These three and other equally certain components of global environmental change are the primary causes of anticipated changes in climate, and of ongoing losses of biological diversity. They are caused in turn by the extraordinary growth in size and resource use of the human population. On a broad scale, there is little uncertainty about any of these components of change or their causes. However, much of the public believes the causes-even the existence-of global change to be uncertain and contentious topics. By speaking out effectively, we can help to shift the focus of public discussion towards what can and should be done about global environmental change.},

  abstract = {Plant adaptation to drought has been extensively studied at many scales from ecology to molecular biology across a large range of model species. However, the conceptual frameworks underpinning the definition of plant strategies, and the terminology used across the different disciplines and scales are not analogous. `Drought resistance' for instance refers to plant responses as different as the maintenance of growth and productivity in crops, to the survival and recovery in perennial woody or grassland species. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a unified conceptual framework of plant adaptive strategies to drought based on a revised terminology in order to enhance comparative studies. Ecological strategies encapsulate plant adaptation to multidimensional variation in resource variability but cannot account for the dynamic and short-term responses to fluctuations in water availability. Conversely, several plant physiological strategies have been identified along the mono-dimensional gradient of water availability in a given environment. According to a revised terminology, dehydration escape, dehydration avoidance, dehydration tolerance, dormancy, and desiccation tolerance are clearly distinguishable. Their sequential expression is expressed as water deficit increases while cavitation tolerance is proposed here to be a major hydraulic strategy underpinning adaptive responses to drought of vascular plants. This continuum of physiological strategies can be interpreted in the context of the ecological trade-off between water-acquisition vs. water-conservation, since growth maintenance is associated with fast water use under moderate drought while plant survival after growth cessation is associated with slow water use under severe drought. Consequently, the distinction between `drought resistance' and `drought survival', is emphasized as crucial to ensure a correct interpretation of plant strategies since `knowing when not to grow' does not confer `drought resistance' but may well enhance `drought survival'. This framework proposal should improve cross-fertilization between disciplines to help tackle the increasing worldwide challenges that drought poses to plant adaptation.},

  abstract = {Higher densities of tree microhabitats in unmanaged forests may explain biodiversity differences with managed forests. To better understand the determinants of this potential biodiversity indicator, we studied the influence of tree characteristics on a set of tree microhabitats (e.g. cavities, cracks, bark features) on 75 plots in managed and unmanaged French forests. We hypothesized that the number of different microhabitat types per tree and the occurrence of a given microhabitat type on a tree would be higher in unmanaged than in managed forests, and that this difference could be linked to individual tree characteristics: diameter, vitality and species. We show that unmanaged forests contained more trees likely to host microhabitats (i.e. large trees, snags) at the stand level. However, at the tree level, forest management did not influence microhabitats; only tree characteristics did: large trees and snags contained more microhabitats. The number and occurrence of microhabitats also varied with tree species: oaks and beech generally hosted more microhabitats, but occurrence of certain types of microhabitats was higher on fir and spruce. We conclude that, even though microhabitats are not equally distributed between managed and unmanaged forests, two trees with similar characteristics in similar site conditions have the same number and probability of occurrence of microhabitats, whatever the management type. In order to preserve biodiversity, foresters could reproduce unmanaged forest features in managed forests through the conservation of specific tree types (e.g. veteran trees, snags). Tree microhabitats could also be more often targeted in sustainable forest management monitoring. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

It shows how diversification can be utilized to offset the riskiness of individual securities, so that portfolios consisting of large numbers of higher risk securities may be less risky than portfolios consisting of small numbers of low risk securities, yet earn a substantially higher rate of return. The correlation of the portfolio to the market index, measured by R-square, indicates how much of the variability in the returns on the portfolio is associated with variability in the market. Selecting stocks to minimize risk in the individual stock on grounds of safety/quality/prudence, rather than in the context of a diversified portfolio, restricts the very risk that theory suggests bears systematic compensation in favor of risks that do not bear compensation. Investment performance can often be improved by expanding the list of qualified securities to include higher return, higher risk stocks, while offsetting the increase in market risk through more effective diversification. Small accounts should be encouraged to pool their assets to exploit these possibilities.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) is increasing, which increases leaf-scale photosynthesis and intrinsic water-use efficiency. These direct responses have the potential to increase plant growth, vegetation biomass, and soil organic matter; transferring carbon from the atmosphere into terrestrial ecosystems (a carbon sink). A substantial global terrestrial carbon sink would slow the rate of [CO2] increase and thus climate change. However, ecosystem CO2 responses are complex or confounded by concurrent changes in multiple agents of global change and evidence for a [CO2]-driven terrestrial carbon sink can appear contradictory. Here we synthesize theory and broad, multidisciplinary evidence for the effects of increasing [CO2] (iCO2) on the global terrestrial carbon sink. Evidence suggests a substantial increase in global photosynthesis since pre-industrial times. Established theory, supported by experiments, indicates that iCO2 is likely responsible for about half of the increase. Global carbon budgeting, atmospheric data, and forest inventories indicate a historical carbon sink, and these apparent iCO2 responses are high in comparison to experiments and predictions from theory. Plant mortality and soil carbon iCO2 responses are highly uncertain. In conclusion, a range of evidence supports a positive terrestrial carbon sink in response to iCO2, albeit with uncertain magnitude and strong suggestion of a role for additional agents of global change.},

  abstract = {Mechanistic photosynthesis models are at the heart of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) simulating the daily, monthly, annual and decadal rhythms of carbon assimilation ( A ). These models are founded on robust mathematical hypotheses that describe how A responds to changes in light and atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Two predominant photosynthesis models are in common usage: Farquhar (FvCB) and Collatz (CBGB). However, a detailed quantitative comparison of these two models has never been undertaken. In this study, we unify the FvCB and CBGB models to a common parameter set and use novel multi-hypothesis methods (that account for both hypothesis and parameter variability) for process-level sensitivity analysis. These models represent three key biological processes: carboxylation, electron transport, triose phosphate use (TPU) and an additional model process: limiting-rate selection. Each of the four processes comprises 1--3 alternative hypotheses giving 12 possible individual models with a total of 14 parameters. To broaden inference, TBM simulations were run and novel, high-resolution photosynthesis measurements were made. We show that parameters associated with carboxylation are the most influential parameters but also reveal the surprising and marked dominance of the limiting-rate selection process (accounting for 57\% of the variation in A vs. 22\% for carboxylation). The limiting-rate selection assumption proposed by CBGB smooths the transition between limiting rates and always reduces A below the minimum of all potentially limiting rates, by up to 25\%, effectively imposing a fourth limitation on A . Evaluation of the CBGB smoothing function in three TBMs demonstrated a reduction in global A by 4\%--10\%, equivalent to 50\%--160\% of current annual fossil fuel emissions. This analysis reveals a surprising and previously unquantified influence of a process that has been integral to many TBMs for decades, highlighting the value of multi-hypothesis methods.},

Complementary to previous studies that evaluated the snow albedo as part of an overall land model study, the snow albedo formulations as used in four major weather forecasting and climate models [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) "Noah" land model, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Land Model (CLM3), and NCEP global model] were directly evaluated here using multiyear Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) in situ data over grass and forest sites. First, four idealized cases over grass and forest sites were designed to understand better the different albedo formulations in these models. Then the BOREAS data were used to evaluate snow albedo and relevant formulations and to identify deficiencies of each model. Based on these analyses, suggestions that involve only minor changes in parameters or formulations were made to significantly reduce these deficiencies of each model. For theECMWFland model, using the square root of snow water equivalent (SWE), rather than SWE itself, in the computation of snow fraction would significantly reduce the under-estimation of albedo over grass. For the NCEP Noah land model, reducing (increasing) the critical SWE for full snow cover over short (tall) vegetation would reduce the underestimate (overestimate) of snow albedo over the grass (forest) site. For the NCAR CLM3, revising the coefficient used in the ground snow-fraction computation would substantially reduce the albedo underestimation over grass. For the albedo formulations in the NCEP global model, replacing the globally constant fresh snow albedo by the vegetation-type-dependent Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) maximum snow albedo would significantly improve the overestimation of model albedo over forest. {\copyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

The latter two theoretical expressions combine MOST with surface energy balance. Estimates of E can differ substantially between these three approaches because of their use of different input data. Surface and satellite-based measurement systems can provide accurate estimates of diurnal, daily, and annual variability of E. But their estimation of longer time variability is largely not established. A reasonable estimate of E as a global mean can be obtained from a surface water budget method, but its regional distribution is still rather uncertain. Current land surface models provide widely different ratios of the transpiration by vegetation to total E. This source of uncertainty therefore limits the capability of models to provide the sensitivities of E to precipitation deficits and land cover change. {\copyright} 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Results: The geometric means of fine-root C, N, and P concentrations were 448.81, 10.73, and 0.9 mg/g, respectively, whereas C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios were 41.84, 508.32, and 11.73, respectively. The fine-root elemental concentrations and their ratios varied widely among plant groups and biomes, and showed clear latitudinal and longitudinal trends, as a consequence of differences in climate, soil, and plant type. However, plant type was the largest contributor to the total variance in fine-root C, N, and P and their ratios compared to climate factors or soil features. Main conclusions: The data reveal the existence of broad biogeographical patterns of fine-root C:N:P stoichiometry in China. These results advance our knowledge about the biogeochemical cycling of fine roots.},

There has been a decline over recent decades in the contribution of CFE to vegetation photosynthesis, perhaps owing to the limiting effects of plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This declining trend has not been adequately accounted for in carbon cycle models. CFE thus has limitations for long-term mitigation of climate change, and future warming might currently be underestimated.},

Over the cultivated regions, woody crops induce stronger cooling effects than herbaceous crops due to larger evapotranspiration rates and smaller aerodynamic resistance.

Sensitivity tests show that the temperature change is robust for eucalypt but more uncertain for switchgrass among different cultivation maps.

The historical evolution and global distribution of column ozone and the amount of tropospheric aerosols are reasonably simulated in the model based on the Representative Concentration Pathways' (RCP) historical emissions of these precursors. The simulated distributions of the terrestrial and marine biogeochemistry parameters agree with recent observations, which is encouraging to use the model for future global change projections.},

  abstract = {lthough the world's 7.6 billion people represent only 0.01\% of all living things by weight, humanity has already caused the loss of 83\% of all wild mammals and half of all plants. The current rate of extinction is tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10 million years -- and it is accelerating. Current production and consumption patterns, land use and urbanization, population dynamics, trade, industry and governance models underpin this loss, calling for a radical reset of humanity's relationship with nature. Consequently, it is not surprising that the World Economic Forum's 2020 Global Risks Report (GRR), through its comprehensive risks perception survey, ranks biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as one of the top five risks in terms of likelihood and impact in the coming 10 years. Yet general confusion persists on what amount of nature loss has occurred, why it relates to human prosperity and how to confront its loss in a practical manner, especially in the business world. Following on the heels of the 2020 GRR, this report provides a deep dive into how nature loss is material to businesses in all industry sectors and makes a clear argument for nature-related risks to be regularly identified, assessed and disclosed by business -- as is now increasingly the case for climate change risks. This will help prevent risk mispricing and inaccurate capital buffers, as well as guiding action to mitigate and adapt business activities that degrade and destroy nature. Human societies and economic activities rely on biodiversity in fundamental ways. Our research shows that \$44 trillion of economic value generation -- more than half of the world's total GDP -- is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services and is therefore exposed to nature loss. Together, the three largest sectors that are highly dependent on nature generate close to \$8 trillion of gross value added (GVA): construction (\$4 trillion); agriculture (\$2.5 trillion); and food and beverages (\$1.4 trillion). This is roughly twice the size of the German economy. While the risk to primary industries is straightforward to grasp, the consequences for secondary and tertiary industries can also be significant. For example, six industries -- chemicals and materials; aviation, travel and tourism; real estate; mining and metals; supply chain and transport; retail, consumer goods and lifestyle -- with less than 15\% of their direct GVA highly dependent on nature, still have ``hidden dependencies'' through their supply chains. More than 50\% of the GVA of their supply chains is highly or moderately dependent on nature. Nature},

Branchwood surface area, in particular, has significant implications for many ecophysiological processes including total respiration and interception of radiation and rainfall. Branch surface area was estimated at the branch-, tree-, and stand-level for 33 Douglas-fir (Pseduotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) plantations in the Oregon Coast Range. Patterns in WAI, leaf area index (LAI; total surface area of needles per unit of land area), tree area index (TAI=WAI+LAI) and various ratios of these dimensions were then investigated. The main axes of primary branches (those attached to the main stem) comprised 82{\textpm}13\% of total branchwood surface area. Tree surface area (needles + woody tissue) increased with increasing tree size and crown length, and decreased with greater intensity of Swiss needle cast (SNC). At the stand-level, woody surface area increased with greater stand density and decreased with more severe SNC, but on average it constituted 29{\textpm}12\% of total tree surface area. Branchwood surface area and bole surface area contributed equally to WAI. The variation in WAI for a given LAI has important implications for radiation and rainfall attenuation in these stands and for accurate partitioning of intercepted radiation between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues. {\copyright} 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, a large number of studies have investigated the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, most of which focussed on a limited set of ecosystem variables. The Jena Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for functional biodiversity research. First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an ecosystem. About 45\% of different types of ecosystem processes measured in the `main experiment', where plant species richness ranged from 1 to 60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness, providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when plant communities experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This highlights the need to revisit diversity--stability theory. Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not instead of, effects of plant species richness. Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was stronger for above- than for belowground organisms, and stronger for herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger than the effect on species abundances. Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g. carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species richness. Variables of the N cycle responded less strongly to plant species richness than variables of the C cycle. Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the biodiversity--ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment, most investigated plant traits, both above- and belowground, were plastic and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way, suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits to particular functions. Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. soil carbon storage and greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground invertebrates, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments, supported the important role of the biotic component for element and water fluxes. Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency. Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to that of conventionally used energy crops. These results suggest that diverse `High Nature Value Grasslands' are multifunctional and can deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related services. A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in biodiversity--ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the effort (in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect monoculture performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments. To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait differences leading to complementarity in resource uptake. Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible.},

As the population of the world increases so does the amount of wood people use. Large areas of natural forests are being cleared every year and converted to other uses. Almost as large an area of plantation forests is being established annually to replace those lost natural forests. Eventually, plantations will produce a large proportion of the wood used around the world for firewood, building, the manufacture of paper and bioenergy. Forest plantations can also provide various environmental benefits including carbon storage, rehabilitation of degraded land, serving as disposal sites for various forms of industrial or agricultural waste and enhancing biodiversity in regions that have been largely cleared for agriculture. Whatever their motivation, plantation forest growers want their plantations to be healthy and grow rapidly to achieve their purpose as soon as possible. This book discusses how this is done. It is written for a worldwide audience, from forestry professionals and scientists through to small plantation growers, and describes how plantations may be grown responsibly and profitably.},

  abstract = {Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) has gained international attention over the past decade, as manifested in both United Nations policy discussions and hundreds of voluntary projects launched to earn carbon-offset credits. There are ongoing discussions about whether and how projects should be integrated into national climate change mitigation efforts under the Paris Agreement. One consideration is whether these projects have generated additional impacts over and above national policies and other measures. To help inform these discussions, we compare the crediting baselines established ex-ante by voluntary REDD+ projects in the Brazilian Amazon to counterfactuals constructed ex-post based on the quasi-experimental synthetic control method. We find that the crediting baselines assume consistently higher deforestation than counterfactual forest loss in synthetic control sites. This gap is partially due to decreased deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon during the early implementation phase of the REDD+ projects considered here. This suggests that forest carbon finance must strike a balance between controlling conservation investment risk and ensuring the environmental integrity of carbon emission offsets. Relatedly, our results point to the need to better align project- and national-level carbon accounting.},

  abstract = {Western diets are characterised by a high intake of meat, dairy products and eggs, causing an intake of saturated fat and red meat in quantities that exceed dietary recommendations. The associated livestock production requires large areas of land and lead to high nitrogen and greenhouse gas emission levels. Although several studies have examined the potential impact of dietary changes on greenhouse gas emissions and land use, those on health, the agricultural system and other environmental aspects (such as nitrogen emissions) have only been studied to a limited extent. By using biophysical models and methods, we examined the large-scale consequences in the European Union of replacing 25-50\% of animal-derived foods with plant-based foods on a dietary energy basis, assuming corresponding changes in production. We tested the effects of these alternative diets and found that halving the consumption of meat, dairy products and eggs in the European Union would achieve a 40\% reduction in nitrogen emissions, 25-40\% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and 23\% per capita less use of cropland for food production. In addition, the dietary changes would also lower health risks. The European Union would become a net exporter of cereals, while the use of soymeal would be reduced by 75\%. The nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of the food system would increase from the current 18\% to between 41\% and 47\%, depending on choices made regarding land use. As agriculture is the major source of nitrogen pollution, this is expected to result in a significant improvement in both air and water quality in the EU. The resulting 40\% reduction in the intake of saturated fat would lead to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality. These diet-led changes in food production patterns would have a large economic impact on livestock farmers and associated supply-chain actors, such as the feed industry and meat-processing sector. {\copyright} 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract = {It is now accepted that some human-induced climate change is unavoidable. Potential impacts on water supply have received much attention, but relatively little is known about the concomitant changes in water quality. Projected changes in air temperature and rainfall could affect river flows and, hence, the mobility and dilution of contaminants. Increased water temperatures will affect chemical reaction kinetics and, combined with deteriorations in quality, freshwater ecological status. With increased flows there will be changes in stream power and, hence, sediment loads with the potential to alter the morphology of rivers and the transfer of sediments to lakes, thereby impacting freshwater habitats in both lake and stream systems. This paper reviews such impacts through the lens of UK surface water quality. Widely accepted climate change scenarios suggest more frequent droughts in summer, as well as flash-flooding, leading to uncontrol-led discharges from urban areas to receiving water courses and estuaries. Invasion by alien species is highly likely, as is migration of species within the UK adapting to changing temperatures and flow regimes. Lower flows, reduced velocities and, hence, higher water residence times in rivers and lakes will enhance the potential for toxic algal blooms and reduce dissolved oxygen levels. Upland streams could experience increased dissolved organic carbon and colour levels, requiring action at water treatment plants to prevent toxic by-products entering public water supplies. Storms that terminate drought periods will flush nutrients from urban and rural areas or generate acid pulses in acidified upland catchments. Policy responses to climate change, such as the growth of bio-fuels or emission controls, will further impact freshwater quality. Copyright {\copyright} 2009 IAHS Press.},

In this study, a comprehensive data set of 1460 soil profiles completely sampled down to the parent material or at least to a depth of 1 m was used to spatially predict SOC stocks for the state of Bavaria in southeast Germany using a geostatistical modeling approach. The model predicted SOC stocks of the main land uses cropland, grassland and forest with an explained variance of 52\% of the total SOC variability within Bavaria. The most important factors, which control the spatial variability of SOC storage, were land use, soil type, soil moisture (indicated by the topographic wetness index) and climate (precipitation, temperature). An analysis of the generated SOC map showed that low to medium SOC stocks within the largest part of Bavaria were explained by land use whereas areas of high SOC stocks in floodplains along rivers, bogs and mountainous regions in the Alps and low mountain ranges were related to soil moisture, soil type and climate. A total SOC stock of 760 Mt was calculated for Bavaria with 223 Mt (29\%) in cropland soils, 125 Mt (16\%) in grassland soils, 257 Mt (34\%) in forest soils, 7-29 Mt (1-4\%) in bogs and 159 Mt (21\%) under other land uses. In view of high SOC stocks in floodplains and mountainous areas, major anthropogenic disturbances of respective soils (e.g. intensification of the land use) should be avoided in these regions.},

However, in almost all simulation studies assessing biogeophysical climate effects of LCC, local effects (due to alterations in a model grid box) are mingled with nonlocal effects (due to changes in wide-ranging climate circulation). This study presents a method to robustly identify local effects by changing land surface properties in selected "LCC boxes" (where local plus nonlocal effects are present), while leaving others unchanged (where only nonlocal effects are present). While this study focuses on the climate effects of LCC, the method presented here is applicable to any land surface process that is acting locally but is capable of influencing wide-ranging climate when applied on a larger scale. Concerning LCC, the method is more widely applicable than methods used in earlier studies. The study illustrates the possibility of validating simulated local effects by comparison to observations on a global scale and contrasts the underlying mechanisms of local and nonlocal effects. In the MPI-ESM, the change in background climate induced by extensive deforestation is not strong enough to influence the local effects substantially, at least as long as sea surface temperatures are not affected. Accordingly, the local effects within a grid box are largely independent of the number of LCC boxes in the isolation approach.},

Satellite-based observations typically register deforestation-induced changes in surface temperature, in-situ observations register changes in near-surface air temperature, and climate models simulate changes in both temperatures and the temperature of the lowest atmospheric layer. Yet a focused analysis of how these variables respond differently to deforestation is missing. Here, this is investigated by analyzing the biogeophysical temperature effects of large-scale deforestation in the climate model MPI-ESM, separately for local effects (which are only apparent at the location of deforestation) and nonlocal effects (which are also apparent elsewhere). While the nonlocal effects affect the temperature of the surface and lowest atmospheric layer equally, the local effects mainly affect the temperature of the surface. In agreement with observation-based studies, the local effects on surface and near-surface air temperature respond differently in the MPI-ESM, both concerning the magnitude of local temperature changes and the latitude at which the local deforestation effects turn from a cooling to a warming (at 45\&amp;ndash;55\&amp;deg;N for surface temperature and around 35\&amp;deg;N for near-surface air temperature). An inter-model comparison shows that in the northern mid latitudes, both for summer and winter, near-surface air temperature is affected by the 5local effects only about half as much compared to surface temperature. Thus, studies about the biogeophysical effects of deforestation must carefully choose which temperature they consider.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We find that the locally induced changes in surface temperature are dominated by changes in surface roughness for the annual mean, the response of the diurnal amplitude, and the seasonal response to deforestation. For these three quantities, the results of the MPI-ESM lie within the range of observation-based data sets. Deforestation-induced decreases in surface roughness contribute substantially to winter cooling in the boreal regions and to decreases in evapotranspiration in the tropics.

We show that a nonlocal cooling in models, which is excluded from observations, may strongly contribute to these conflicting results. For the MPI-ESM, the globally averaged nonlocal cooling exceeds the globally averaged local warming by a factor of three, for global deforestation but also for realistic areal extents and spatial distributions of deforestation. Furthermore, the globally averaged nonlocal effects dominate the local effects in realistic scenarios across a range of climate models. We conclude that observations alone are not sufficient to capture the full biogeophysical effects, and climate models are needed to better understand and quantify the full effects of deforestation before they are considered in strategies for climate mitigation.},

However, functional diversity is not independent of climate and management, and it is important to understand the role of functional diversity and these dependencies for ecosystem functions of permanent grasslands. Especially since functional diversity may play a key role in mediating impacts of changing conditions. Large-scale ecosystem models are used to assess ecosystem functions within a consistent framework for 5 multiple climate and management scenarios. However, large-scale models of permanent grasslands rarely consider functional diversity. We implemented a representation of functional diversity based on the CSR theory and the global spectrum of plant form and function into the LPJmL dynamic global vegetation model forming LPJmL-CSR. Using a Bayesian calibration method, we parameterised new plant functional types and used these to assess forage supply, soil organic carbon storage and community composition of three permanent grassland sites. These are a temperate grassland, a hot and a cold steppe for 10 which we simulated several management scenarios with different defoliation intensities and resource limitations. LPJmL-CSR captured the grassland dynamics well under observed conditions and showed improved results for forage supply and/or SOC compared to LPJmL 5.3 at three grassland sites. Furthermore, LPJmL-CSR was able to reproduce the trade-offs associated with the global spectrum of plant form and function and similar strategies emerged independent of the site specific conditions (e.g. the C-and R-PFTs were more resource exploitative than S-PFTs). Under different resource limitations, we observed a shift 15 of the community composition. At the hot steppe for example, irrigation led to a more balanced community composition with similar C-, Sand R-PFT shares of above-ground biomass. Our results show, that LPJmL-CSR allows for explicit analysis of the adaptation of grassland vegetation to changing conditions while explicitly considering functional diversity. The implemented},

We explore the implications of fully integrating terrestrial systems and the energy system into a comprehensive mitigation regime that limits atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. We find that this comprehensive approach lowers the cost of meeting environmental goals but also carries with it profound implications for agriculture: Unmanaged ecosystems and forests expand, and food crop and livestock prices rise. Finally, we find that future improvement in food crop productivity directly affects land-use change emissions, making the technology for growing crops potentially important for limiting atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. T here is increasing concern over the connection between fossil and industrial emissions and terrestrial ecosystem emissions, and the implications of this interaction for climate change mitigation strategies. Several research studies (1-8) have shown that the outcome of imposing a mitigation regime that only values carbon from energy and industrial sources creates incentives to increase bioenergy. As the use of bioenergy increases, land uses shift from food and fiber crops, forests, and unmanaged ecosystems to dedicated biomass crops. This in turn increases terrestrial carbon emissions globally-a perverse result of curbing energy and industrial emissions.},

  abstract = {We performed simulations of future biophysical vegetation-climate feedbacks with a regional Earth System Model, RCA-GUESS, interactively coupling a regional climate model and a process-based model of vegetation dynamics and biogeochemistry. Simulated variations in leaf area index and in the relative coverage of evergreen forest, deciduous forest, and open land vegetation in response to simulated climate influence atmospheric state via variations in albedo, surface roughness, and the partitioning of the land-atmosphere heat flux into latent and sensible components. The model was applied on a {$\sim$}50 {\texttimes} 50 km grid over Europe under a future climate scenario. Three potential "hot spots" of vegetation-climate feedbacks could be identified. In the Scandinavian Mountains, reduced albedo resulting from the snow-masking effect of forest expansion enhanced the winter warming trend. In central Europe, the stimulation of photosynthesis and plant growth by "CO{$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$} fertilization" mitigated warming, through a negative evapotranspiration feedback associated with increased vegetation cover and leaf area index. In southern Europe, increased summer dryness restricted plant growth and survival, causing a positive warming feedback through reduced evapotranspiration. Our results suggest that vegetation-climate feedbacks over the European study area will be rather modest compared to the radiative forcing of increased global CO{$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$} concentrations but may modify warming projections locally, regionally, and seasonally, compared with results from traditional "off-line" regional climate models lacking a representation of the relevant feedback mechanisms.

In theory, some appealing features should enable PES to perform well in achieving conservation and welfare goals. In practice, outcomes depend on the interplay between context, design and implementation. Inspecting a new global dataset, we find that some PES design principles pre-identified in the social-science literature as desirable, such as spatial targeting and payment differentiation, are only partially being applied in practice. More importantly, the PES-defining principle of conditionality-monitoring compliance and sanctioning detected non-compliance-is seldom being implemented. Administrative ease, multiple non-environmental side objectives and social equity concerns may jointly help explain the reluctance to adopt more sophisticated, theoretically informed practices. However, by taking simplifying shortcuts in design and implementation, PES programmes may become less environmentally effective and efficient as economic incentives, thus underperforming their conservation potential.},

Considerable attention has been paid to quantifying these industrial process emissions from cement production, but the natural reversal of the process - carbonation - has received little attention in carbon cycle studies. Here, we use new and existing data on cement materials during cement service life, demolition, and secondary use of concrete waste to estimate regional and global CO 2 uptake between 1930 and 2013 using an analytical model describing carbonation chemistry. We find that carbonation of cement materials over their life cycle represents a large and growing net sink of CO 2, increasing from 0.10 GtC yr {\^a} '1 in 1998 to 0.25 GtC yr {\^a} '1 in 2013. In total, we estimate that a cumulative amount of 4.5 GtC has been sequestered in carbonating cement materials from 1930 to 2013, offsetting 43\% of the CO 2 emissions from production of cement over the same period, not including emissions associated with fossil use during cement production. We conclude that carbonation of cement products represents a substantial carbon sink that is not currently considered in emissions inventories.},

Current process-based ecosystem models used for estimating GPP are subject to large uncertainties due to poorly constrained parameter values.

We also applied the generalized likelihood estimation (GLUE) method, which is flexible for a multi-parameter calibration, to optimize the GPP simulation by BEPS for 10 sites covering 7 plant functional types (PFT) over China. Our optimized results significantly reduced the uncertainty of the simulated GPP over all the sites by 17 \% to 82 \% and showed that the GPP is sensitive to not only the photosynthesis-related parameters but also the parameters related to the soil water uptake as well as to the energy balance. The optimized GPP across South China showed that the mix forest, shrub, and grass have a higher GPP and are more controlled by the soil water availability. This study showed that the GLUE method together with the GSA scheme could constrain the ecosystem model well when simulating GPP across multiple ecosystems and provide a reasonable estimate of the spatial and temporal distribution of the ecosystem GPP over China. We call for more observations from more sites, as well as data on plant traits, to be collected in China in order to better constrain ecosystem carbon cycle modeling and understand its response to climate change.},

Four plant functional types were parameterized on the basis of meta-analysis of plant hydraulic traits. Simulations from both the original and the updated ED2 were evaluated against 5~yr of field data from a Costa Rican SDTF site and remote-sensing data over Central America. The updated model generated realistic plant hydraulic dynamics, such as leaf water potential and stem sap flow. Compared with the original ED2, predictions from our novel trait-driven model matched better with observed growth, phenology and their variations among functional groups. Most notably, the original ED2 produced unrealistically small leaf area index (LAI) and underestimated cumulative leaf litter. Both of these biases were corrected by the updated model. The updated model was also better able to simulate spatial patterns of LAI dynamics in Central America. Plant hydraulic traits are intercorrelated in SDTFs. Mechanistic incorporation of plant hydraulic traits is necessary for the simulation of spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation dynamics in SDTFs in vegetation models.},

However, the detrimental effects of climate change on crop yields may reduce the capacity of BECCS and threaten food security6--8, thus creating an unrecognized positive feedback loop on global warming. We quantified the strength of this feedback by implementing the responses of crop yields to increases in growing-season temperature, atmospheric CO2 concentration and intensity of nitrogen (N) fertilization in a compact Earth system model9. Exceeding a threshold of climate change would cause transformative changes in social--ecological systems by jeopardizing climate stability and threatening food security. If global mitigation alongside large-scale BECCS is delayed to 2060 when global warming exceeds about 2.5 {$^\circ$}C, then the yields of agricultural residues for BECCS would be too low to meet the Paris goal of 2 {$^\circ$}C by 2200. This risk of failure is amplified by the sustained demand for food, leading to an expansion of cropland or intensification of N fertilization to compensate for climate-induced yield losses. Our findings thereby reinforce the urgency of early mitigation, preferably by 2040, to avoid irreversible climate change and serious food crises unless other negative-emission technologies become available in the near future to compensate for the reduced capacity of BECCS.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Vegetation plays a key role in the global carbon cycle and thus is an important component within Earth system models (ESMs) that project future climate. Many ESMs are adopting methods to resolve plant size and ecosystem disturbance history, using vegetation demographic models. These models make it feasible to conduct more realistic simulation of processes that control vegetation dynamics. Meanwhile, increasing understanding of the processes governing plant water use, and ecosystem responses to drought in particular, has led to the adoption of dynamic plant water transport (i.e., hydrodynamic) schemes within ESMs. However, the extent to which variations in plant hydraulic traits affect both plant water stress and the risk of mortality in trait-diverse tropical forests is understudied. In this study, we report on a sensitivity analysis of an existing hydrodynamic scheme (HYDRO) model that is updated and incorporated into the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) (FATES--HYDRO V1.0). The size- and canopy-structured representation within FATES is able to simulate how plant size and hydraulic traits affect vegetation dynamics and carbon--water fluxes. To better understand this new model system, and its functionality in tropical forest systems in particular, we conducted a global parameter sensitivity analysis at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We assembled 942 observations of plant hydraulic traits on 306 tropical plant species for stomata, leaves, stems, and roots and determined the best-fit statistical distribution for each trait, which was used in model parameter sampling to assess the parametric sensitivity. We showed that, for simulated leaf water potential and loss of hydraulic conductivity across different plant organs, the four most important traits were associated with xylem conduit taper (buffers increasing hydraulic resistance with tree height), stomatal sensitivity to leaf water potential, maximum stem hydraulic conductivity, and the partitioning of total hydraulic resistance above vs. belowground. Our analysis of individual ensemble members revealed that trees at a high risk of hydraulic failure and potential tree mortality generally have a lower conduit taper, lower maximum xylem conductivity, lower stomatal sensitivity to leaf water potential, and lower resistance to xylem embolism for stem and transporting roots. We expect that our results will provide guidance on future modeling studies using plant hydrodynamic models to predict the forest responses to droughts and future field campaigns that aim to better parameterize plant hydrodynamic models.},

  abstract = {A global scale Dynamic Nitrogen scheme (DyN) has been developed and incorporated into the Lund-Posdam-Jena (LPJ) dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). The DyN is a comprehensive process-based model of the cycling of N through and within terrestrial ecosystems, with fully interactive coupling to vegetation and C dynamics. The model represents the uptake, allocation and turnover of N in plants, and soil N transformations including mineralization, N2 fixation, nitrification and denitrification, NH3 volatilization, N leaching, and N2, N2O and NO production and emission. Modelled global patterns of site-scale nitrogen fluxes and reservoirs are highly correlated to observations reported from different biomes. The simulation of site-scale net primary production and soil carbon content was improved relative to the original LPJ, which lacked an interactive N cycle, especially in the temporal and boreal regions. Annual N uptake by global natural vegetation was simulated as 1.084PgNyr-1, with lowest values {$<$}1gNm-2 yr-1 (polar desert) and highest values in the range 24-36.5gNm-2 yr-1 (tropical forests). Simulated global patterns of annual N uptake are consistent with previous model results by Melillo et al. The model estimates global total nitrogen storage potentials in vegetation (5.3PgN), litter (4.6PgN) and soil ({$\geq$}67Pg as organic N and 0.94Pg as inorganic N). Simulated global patterns of soil N storage are consistent with the analysis by Post et al. although total simulated N storage is less. Deserts were simulated to store 460TgN (up to 0.262kgNm-2) as NO3-, contributing 80\% of the global total NO3- inventory of 580TgN. This model result is in agreement with the findings of a large NO3- pool beneath deserts. Globally, inorganic soil N is a small reservoir, comprising only 1.6\% of the global soil N content to 1.5 m soil depth, but the ratio has a very high spatial variability and in hot desert regions, inorganic NO3- is estimated to be the dominant form of stored N in the soil. {\copyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\copyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

  abstract = {Problematic Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combi-nation of saccades and smooth eye movements. These movements allow us to align and stabilize the object on the fovea, thus en-abling high-resolution visual detection. When predictive informa-tion is available about target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. It is generally assumed that the role of anticipatory eye movements is to limit the behavioral impairment due to eye-to-target position and velocity mismatch. By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of aSPEM, as mea-sured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp-motion onset. This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements [1]. However, such estimate may become particularly challenging in a dynamic context, where the probabilistic contingencies vary in time in an unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the infor-mation processing underlying the buildup of aSPEM is linked to an explicit estimate of probabilities is unknown. Material and Method In order to answer these questions, we have set up an experi-ment comprising 3 blocks of 200 trials. For each trial, a tar-get makes either to the left or to the right, this direction being drawn from a Bernoulli process. The probability of this process varied in a piecewise-constant (that is, a step function varying be-tween 0 and 1), similarly to Meyniel et al. [2]. The occurence of these switches is itself drawn from a Bernoulli process of probability p switch = 1/40. We asked subjects to perform two tasks on different days :},

  abstract = {Abstract. Extreme drought events in Amazon forests are expected to become more frequent and more intense with climate change, threatening ecosystem function and carbon balance. Yet large uncertainties exist on the resilience of this ecosystem to drought. A better quantification of tree hydraulics and mortality processes is needed to anticipate future drought effects on Amazon forests. Most state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation models are relatively poor in their mechanistic description of these complex processes. Here, we implement a mechanistic plant hydraulic module within the ORCHIDEE-CAN-NHA r7236 land surface model to simulate the percentage loss of conductance (PLC) and changes in water storage among organs via a representation of the water potentials and vertical water flows along the continuum from soil to roots, stems and leaves. The model was evaluated against observed seasonal variability in stand-scale sap flow, soil moisture and productivity under both control and drought setups at the Caxiuan{\~a} throughfall exclusion field experiment in eastern Amazonia between 2001 and 2008. A relationship between PLC and tree mortality is built in the model from two empirical parameters, the cumulated duration of drought exposure that triggers mortality, and the mortality fraction in each day exceeding the exposure. Our model captures the large biomass drop in the year 2005 observed 4 years after throughfall reduction, and produces comparable annual tree mortality rates with observation over the study period. Our hydraulic architecture module provides promising avenues for future research in assimilating experimental data to parameterize mortality due to drought-induced xylem dysfunction. We also highlight that species-based (isohydric or anisohydric) hydraulic traits should be further tested to generalize the model performance in predicting the drought risks.},

To help clarify a variety of misunderstandings, we distinguish between the empirical claim that efficiency is often associated with rising resource consumption and the causal claim that efficiency leads to greater resource use. We show that at a variety of levels, a positive correlation between efficiency and resource consumption is common, suggesting that there is something to be explained. We then present various reasons that may explain these associations, some of which do not suggest a direct causal link between efficiency and consumption, but rather a connection through other mediating factors, and some of which do suggest a causal connection. We note that political economic theories propose that the effect of efficiency on consumption levels is not necessarily immediate and direct, but rather due to how it affects developmental pathways. We present an empirical analysis, using panel data on nations, which shows that more efficient nations tend to have higher rates of growth in electricity and overall energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, consistent with what political economic theories suggest.},

  abstract = {European temperate and boreal forests sequester up to 12\% of Europe's annual carbon emissions. Forest carbon density can be manipulated through management to maximize its climate mitigation potential, and fast-growing tree species may contribute the most to Climate Smart Forestry (CSF) compared to slow-growing hardwoods. This type of CSF takes into account not only forest resource potentials in sequestering carbon, but also the economic impact of regional forest products and discounts both variables over time. We used the process-based forest model 4 C to simulate European commercial forests' growth conditions and coupled it with an optimization algorithm to simulate the implementation of CSF for 18 European countries encompassing 68.3 million ha of forest (42.4\% of total EU-28 forest area). We found a European CSF policy that could sequester 7.3--11.1 billion tons of carbon, projected to be worth 103 to 141 billion euros in the 21st century. An efficient CSF policy would allocate carbon sequestration to European countries with a lower wood price, lower labor costs, high harvest costs, or a mixture thereof to increase its economic efficiency. This policy prioritized the allocation of mitigation efforts to northern, eastern and central European countries and favored fast growing conifers Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris to broadleaves Fagus sylvatica and Quercus species.},

  abstract = {We show the implications of the commonly observed age-related decline in aboveground productivity of forests, and hence forest age structure, on the carbon dynamics of European forests in response to historical changes in environmental conditions. Size-dependent carbon allocation in trees to counteract increasing hydraulic resistance with tree height has been hypothesized to be responsible for this decline. Incorporated into a global terrestrial biosphere model (the Lund-Potsdam-Jena model, LPJ), this hypothesis improves the simulated increase in biomass with stand age. Application of the advanced model, including a generic representation of forest management in even-aged stands, for 77 European provinces shows that model-based estimates of biomass development with age compare favorably with inventory-based estimates for different tree species. Model estimates of biomass densities on province and country levels, and trends in growth increment along an annual mean temperature gradient are in broad agreement with inventory data. However, the level of agreement between modeled and inventory-based estimates varies markedly between countries and provinces. The model is able to reproduce the present-day age structure of forests and the ratio of biomass removals to increment on a European scale based on observed changes in climate, atmospheric CO2 concentration, forest area, and wood demand between 1948 and 2000. Vegetation in European forests is modeled to sequester carbon at a rate of 100 Tg C/yr, which corresponds well to forest inventory-based estimates. {\copyright} 2006 by the the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {Climate response of tree-species growth may be influenced by intra- and inter-specific interactions. The different physiological strategies of stress response and resource use among species may lead to different levels of competition and/or complementarity, likely changing in space and time according to climatic conditions. Investigating the drivers of inter- and intra-specific interactions under a changing climate is important when managing mixed and pure stands, especially in a climate change hot spot such as the Mediterranean basin. Mediterranean tree rings show intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs): the links among their occurrence, anatomical traits, wood growth and stable isotope ratios can help understanding tree physiological responses to drought. In this study, we compared wood production and tree-ring traits in Quercus ilex L. dominant trees growing in two pure and two mixed stands with Pinus pinea at two sites in Southern Italy, on the basis of the temporal variation of cumulative basal area, intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE i ), {$\delta$} 18 O and IADF frequency in long tree-ring chronologies. The general aim was to assess whether Q. ilex trees growing in pure or mixed stands have a different wood production through time, depending on climatic conditions and stand structure. The occurrence of dry climatic conditions triggered opposite complementarity interactions for Q. ilex growing with P. pinea trees at the two sites. Competitive reduction was experienced at the T site characterized by higher soil water holding capacity (WHC), lower stand density and less steep slope than the S site; on the opposite, high competition occurred at S site. The observed difference in wood growth was accompanied by a higher WUE i due to a higher photosynthetic rate at the T site, while by a tighter stomatal control in mixed stand of S site. IADF frequency in Q. ilex tree rings was linked to higher WUEi, thus to stressful conditions and could be interpreted as strategy to cope with dry periods, independently from the different wood growth. Considering the forecasted water shortage, inter-specific competition should be reduced in denser stands of Q. ilex mixed with P. pinea. Such findings have important implications for forest management of mixed and pure Q. ilex forests.},

  abstract = {Under the current accounting systems, emissions produced when biomass is burnt for energy are accounted as zero, resulting in what is referred to as the 'carbon neutrality' assumption. However, if current harvest levels are increased to produce more bioenergy, carbon that would have been stored in the biosphere might be instead released in the atmosphere. This study utilizes a comparative approach that considers emissions under alternative energy supply options. This approach shows that the emission benefits of bioenergy compared to use of fossil fuel are time-dependent. It emerges that the assumption that bioenergy always results in zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to use of fossil fuels can be misleading, particularly in the context of short-to-medium term goals. While it is clear that all sources of woody bioenergy from sustainably managed forests will produce emission reductions in the long term, different woody biomass sources have various impacts in the short-medium term. The study shows that the use of forest residues that are easily decomposable can produce GHG benefits compared to use of fossil fuels from the beginning of their use and that biomass from dedicated plantations established on marginal land can be carbon neutral from the beginning of its use. However, the risk of short-to-medium term negative impacts is high when additional fellings are extracted to produce bioenergy and the proportion of felled biomass used for bioenergy is low, or when land with high C stocks is converted to low productivity bioenergy plantations. The method used in the study provides an instrument to identify the time-dependent pattern of emission reductions for alternative bioenergy sources. In this way, decision makers can evaluate which bioenergy options are most beneficial for meeting short-term GHG emission reduction goals and which ones are more appropriate for medium to longer term objectives. {\copyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We studied fine root parameters of a Norway spruce stand treated with reduced input (clean rain) for 13 years. Fine roots of the clean rain plot had smaller N and Al contents, however, fine roots in the subsoil were still subjected to soil acidity and Al toxicity as indicated by a fine root Ca/Al ratio of less than 0.5. The treatment effect was most pronounced in the organic layer of the clean rain plot where fine root biomass increased by 66\% and the live/dead ratio of fine roots increased by more than 100\%. The elevated live/dead ratio was attributed to reduced mortality and faster decomposition of fine root litter. The latter was supported by a positive relationship between live/dead ratio and manganese content of fine roots. In contrast to the organic layer, fine root biomass was not different in the mineral soil. However, at 20-40 cm fine root diameter was greater and specific root tip density was smaller than in the topsoil likely because of strong N limitation as indicated by a C/N ratio of {$>$}50. Based on these morphological changes we postulate differing functional properties of fine roots in the organic layer and mineral soil below 20 cm depth. Further, our results suggest that Picea abies is able to adapt morphology and functional traits of its root system following reduced N availability. {\copyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

A major aspect is the impact of whole-tree harvesting on long-term productivity of forest soils. {$\bullet$} Aims: This study aimed to analyze the effects of nutrient removal on productivity using the historically prevalent practice of litter raking. Since there is a lack of controlled whole-tree harvesting experiments in Germany, we used litter raking as a surrogate management practice entailing the removal of nutrients from forest stands. {$\bullet$} Methods: We used three sites with documented litter raking to analyze the effects of nutrient removal on productivity using dendroecological methods: two recent litter removal experiments in two Scots pine stands (Siegenburg and Burglengenfeld) and one oak stand (Eichhall) with documented historic litter raking. Basal area increment (BAI) and tree-ring characteristics were compared between periods with litter raking and the preceding periods for both treatment and control plots. {$\bullet$} Results: For the two Scots pine sites with a relatively short litter raking period, no effects of litter raking on BAI could be ascribed to nutrient removal. On the oak site with a longer history of litter utilization, the loss in BAI due to litter raking amounts to 22 \% during the period with active raking and to still 17 \% in the recovery period. {$\bullet$} Conclusions: These results contribute to the still very limited understanding about the impact of whole-tree harvesting on forest productivity in Germany by laying down an upper limit of possible effects due to nutrient removal, as nutrient loss by litter raking tends to be higher than nutrient loss by whole-tree harvesting. {\copyright} 2012 INRA / Springer-Verlag France.},

  abstract = {It has been argued in the literature that global temperature increased at a reduced rate between approximately 1998 and 2013, a phenomenon known as the `global warming hiatus'. Statistically motivated studies searching for numerical evidence for this episode typically argue against the detectability of a slowdown. At the same time, process-oriented studies on potential causes of the slowdown are more focused on establishing the consistency between observations and model-based expectations of surface warming. Here, we employ three different gridded temperature data sets, two different statistical tests, and four different sets of periods for defining a baseline period and slowdown period associated to the recent slowdown in surface warming to provide strong evidence against consistent regional patterns of significant changes in the warming trend. Roughly half of the earth's surface has experienced a reduced warming trend during the slowdown period, which is strongly connected to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation as a main source of internal variability of the climate system. This finding is consistent with the understanding of the role of internal decadal variability of the climate obtained from modelling and attribution studies. However, controlling for false discovery rates in the context of multiple testing in the spatial domain, we found that only less than 5\% of the earth's surface have experienced a significant regional slowdown in surface warming. At the same time, for roughly the same small number of grid cells we found the opposite pattern of a significant acceleration in warming. In both cases, the identified areas are not robust against the choice of temperature data set and statistical test, as well as against the delineation of the testing periods for baseline and slowdown periods. Our results demonstrate that similar to previous findings at the global level, statistical testing accounting for the multiple testing nature of the problem argues against a robust detectability of the `warming hiatus' at the regional level.},

  abstract = {Drought is a stochastic natural hazard that is instigated by intense and persistent shortage of precipitation. Following an initial meteorological phenomenon, subsequent impacts are realized on agriculture and hydrology. Among the natural hazards, droughts possess certain unique features; in addition to delayed effects, droughts vary by multiple dynamic dimensions including severity and duration, which in addition to causing a pervasive and subjective network of impacts makes them difficult to characterize. In order manage drought, drought characterization is essential enabling both retrospective analyses (e.g., severity versus impacts analysis) and prospective planning (e.g., risk assessment). The adaptation of a simplified method by drought indices has facilitated drought characterization for various users and entities. More than 100 drought indices have so far been proposed, some of which are operationally used to characterize drought using gridded maps at regional and national levels. These indices correspond to different types of drought, including meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological drought. By quantifying severity levels and declaring drought's start and end, drought indices currently aid in a variety of operations including drought early warning and monitoring and contingency planning. Given their variety and ongoing development, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive overview of available drought indices that highlights their difference and examines the trend in their development. This paper reviews 74 operational and proposed drought indices and describes research directions. {\copyright} 2011 Published by NRC Research Press.},

We employed a customized, Arctic version of the individual-based dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS to simulate the dynamics of upland and wetland ecosystems under a regional climate model-downscaled future climate projection for the Arctic and Subarctic. The simulated vegetation distribution (1961-1990) agreed well with a composite map of actual arctic vegetation. In the future (2051-2080), a poleward advance of the forest-tundra boundary, an expansion of tall shrub tundra, and a dominance shift from deciduous to evergreen boreal conifer forest over northern Eurasia were simulated. Ecosystems continued to sink carbon for the next few decades, although the size of these sinks diminished by the late 21st century. Hot spots of increased CH4 emission were identified in the peatlands near Hudson Bay and western Siberia. In terms of their net impact on regional climate forcing, positive feedbacks associated with the negative effects of tree-line, shrub cover and forest phenology changes on snow-season albedo, as well as the larger sources of CH4, may potentially dominate over negative feedbacks due to increased carbon sequestration and increased latent heat flux. {\copyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Extreme climate events are also becoming more frequent and it is unknown how they will affect feedbacks of CO2 between forest ecosystems and the atmosphere. An improved understanding of species differences at the regional scale of the response of forest productivity to climate variation and extremes is thus important for forecasting forest dynamics. In this study, we evaluate the climate sensitivity of aboveground net primary production (NPP) simulated by two dynamic global vegetation models (DGVM; ORCHIDEE and LPJ-wsl) against tree ring width (TRW) observations from about 1000 sites distributed across Europe. In both the model simulations and the TRW observations, forests in northern Europe and the Alps respond positively to warmer spring and summer temperature, and their overall temperature sensitivity is larger than that of the soil-moisture-limited forests in central Europe and Mediterranean regions. Compared with TRW observations, simulated NPP from ORCHIDEE and LPJ-wsl appear to be overly-sensitive to climatic factors. Our results indicate that the models lack biological processes that control time lags, such as carbohydrate storage and remobilization, that delay the effects of radial growth dynamics to climate. Our study highlights the need for re-evaluating the physiological controls on the climate sensitivity of NPP simulated by DGVMs. In particular, DGVMs could be further enhanced by a more detailed representation of carbon reserves and allocation that control year-to-year variation in plant growth.},

Such changes have affected the near-surface climate through opposing biogeophysical feedbacks (BF) associated with changes to albedo and evapotranspiration. However, the likely spatiotemporal variations of BF to future climate change and the consequences for Arctic vegetation and ecology have not been robustly quantified. We apply a regional Earth system model (RCA-GUESS) interactively coupling atmospheric dynamics to land vegetation response in three potential 21st-century radiative forcing simulations for the Arctic. We find that BF, dominated by albedo-mediated warming in early spring and evapotranspiration-mediated cooling in summer, have the potential to amplify or modulate local warming and enhance summer precipitation over land. The magnitude of these effects depends on radiative forcing and subsequent ecosystem responses. Thus, it is important to account for BF when assessing future Arctic climate change and its ecosystem impacts.},

To explore the correlation and coordination between primary and secondary growth, we monitored the leaf phenology, shoot elongation, and stem growth of co-occurring Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr. and Picea meyeri Rehd. et Wils. in an alpine habitat, Luya Mountain (North-Central China), during the growing season of 2014. We measured bud development on terminal branches three days per week by direct observations and intra-annual stem xylem formation at weekly intervals by the microcores method. The onset sequence of three organs was the needle, shoot, and stem, without species-specific differences. Needles appeared one month earlier than stem growth in larch, while it was only one week earlier in spruce. The duration of needle growth was the shortest, followed by the shoot and stem. The timing of primary growth (i.e., onset, end, and maximum growth rate) between the two species was asynchronous, but secondary growth was synchronic with the same date of the maximum growth rate occurrence, potentially indicating species competition for resources. Unlike larch, spruce staggered growth peaks among different organs, which may effectively mitigate trees' internal competition for resources. Soil temperature was positively correlated with both shoot and stem growth in the two species, whereas air temperature and soil water content were positively correlated with needle growth only in larch. Therefore, it can be inferred that the spruce will probably outcompete the larch at cold alpine treeline sites due to its high adaptability to acquiring and allocating resources. These results provide insight into the potential physiological correlation between primary and secondary growth and allow better prediction of future climate change effects on forest ecosystem productivity.},

  abstract = {Carbon starvation and hydraulic failure are considered important factors in determining the mechanisms associated with tree mortality. In this study, iso/anisohydric classification was used to assess drought resistance and mortality mechanisms in two contrasting poplar species, as it is generally believed that isohydric species are more susceptible to carbon starvation, while anisohydric species are more susceptible to hydraulic failure. However, these assumptions are rarely tested in poplar genotypes with contrasting growth strategies. Thus, we subjected potted poplar genotypes (I-101 (Populus alba L.) Carbon starvation and hydraulic failure are considered important factors in determining the mechanisms associated with tree mortality. In this study, iso/anisohydric classification was used to assess drought resistance and mortality mechanisms in two contrasting poplar species, as it is generally believed that isohydric species are more susceptible to carbon starvation, while anisohydric species are more susceptible to hydraulic failure. However, these assumptions are rarely tested in poplar genotypes with contrasting growth strategies. Thus, we subjected potted poplar genotypes (I-101 (Populus alba L.) x 84K (Populus alba L. x Populus glandulosa Uyeki) with fast and slow growth rates to drought-rehydration treatments. The slow-growing genotype maintained higher stomatal conductance and lower predawn leaf water potential than the fast-growing genotype, thus exhibiting a near-anisohydric stomatal behavior throughout the treatment period. The nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) content indicated that the two genotypes had the same trend of carbon change (e.g., the NSC content in the leaves increased with drought and then decreased). However, when NSC content data were combined with the growth and photosynthetic data, it was observed that the slow-growing genotype mobilized carbon to maintain hydraulic safety, while the NSC content of the fast-growing genotype among tissues was static. The percent loss of hydraulic conductivity in the branches during treatments indicated that the fast-growing genotype could recover more quickly from xylem embolism than the slow-growing genotype. The slow-growing genotype with a slow growth recovery after rehydration showed a significant increase in carbon consumption, combined with a significant increase in the hydraulic safety threshold value, indicating that there may be drought tolerance. In comparison, the fast-growing genotype showed a faster hydraulic recovery ability that had no effect on the NSC content in the leaves and roots. Our findings demonstrate intraspecific isohydric behavior in poplar; however, the trade-off between carbon distribution and stomatal regulation should be considered separately within genotypes of the same species. In addition, NSC plays an important role in water-carbon balance in the drought-rehydration cycle. 84K (Populus alba L. x Populus glandulosa Uyeki) with fast and slow growth rates to drought-rehydration treatments.

Model simulation has developed rapidly and become an irreplaceable method in researching carbon cycle mechanisms and estimating carbon fluxes of forest ecosystems. So far, little research has systematically reviewed the progresses in forest carbon cycle models. A review of forest carbon cycle models on spatiotemporal scales will be timely and valuable. In this paper, the forest carbon cycle models on spatiotemporal scales were reviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of forest carbon cycle models at different spatiotemporal scales were compared. The existing problems of forest carbon cycle models were analysed. Proposals on the prospects of forest carbon cycle models in the future were presented. This review can provide new ideas and a comprehensive understanding on the assessment method development of current forest carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and biological nitrogen (N2) fixation by grain legumes are two major processes of N transformation in agroecosystems. However, the relationship between these two processes is not well understood. The objective of this study was to quantify N2O emissions associated with N2 fixation by grain legumes under controlled conditions. The denitrifying capability of two Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae strains, 99A1 and RGP2, was tested in pure culture in the presence of nitrate and in symbiosis with lentil (Lens esculenta Moench) and pea (Pisum sativum L.), respectively, in sterile Leonard jars. Lentil and pea, either inoculated or N-fertilized, were grown in soil boxes under controlled conditions. Profile N2O concentration and surface N2O emissions were measured from soil-crop systems, and were compared with that of a cereal - spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. ac. Barrie). Results indicated that: 1) neither R. leguminosarum strain, 99A1 or RGP2 was capable of denitrification in pure culture, nor in symbiosis with lentil and pea in sterile Leonard jars, suggesting that introducing these Rhizobium into soils through rhizobial inoculation onto lentil and pea will not increase denitrification or N2O emissions; 2) soil-emitted N2O from well-nodulated lentil and pea crops grown under controlled conditions was not significantly different than that from the check treatments, indicating that biological N2 fixation by lentil and pea was not a direct source of N2O emissions. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 (ca) rise changes the physiology and possibly growth of tropical trees, but these effects are likely modified by climate. Such ca~{\texttimes}~climate interactions importantly drive CO2 fertilization effects of tropical forests predicted by global vegetation models, but have not been tested empirically. Here we use tree-ring analyses to quantify how ca rise has shifted the sensitivity of tree stem growth to annual fluctuations in rainfall and temperature. We hypothesized that ca rise reduces drought sensitivity and increases temperature sensitivity of growth, by reducing transpiration and increasing leaf temperature. These responses were expected for cooler sites. At warmer sites, ca rise may cause leaf temperatures to frequently exceed the optimum for photosynthesis, and thus induce increased drought sensitivity and stronger negative effects of temperature. We tested these hypotheses using measurements of 5,318 annual rings from 129 trees of the widely distributed (sub-)tropical tree species, Toona ciliata. We studied growth responses during 1950--2014, a period during which ca rose by 28\%. Tree-ring data were obtained from two cooler (mean annual temperature: 20.5--20.7{$^\circ$}C) and two warmer (23.5--24.8{$^\circ$}C) sites. We tested ca~{\texttimes}~climate interactions, using mixed-effect models of ring-width measurements. Our statistical models revealed several significant and robust ca~{\texttimes}~climate interactions. At cooler sites (and seasons), ca~{\texttimes}~climate interactions showed good agreement with hypothesized growth responses of reduced drought sensitivity and increased temperature sensitivity. At warmer sites, drought sensitivity increased with increasing ca, as predicted, and hot years caused stronger growth reduction at high ca. Overall, ca rise has significantly modified sensitivity of Toona stem growth to climatic variation, but these changes depended on mean climate. Our study suggests that effects of ca rise on tropical tree growth may be more complex and less stimulatory than commonly assumed and require a better representation in global vegetation models.},
