# Reconciling the EU forest, biodiversity, and climate strategies

## Paper plots
In the Jupyter notebook `full_optimization_plots.ipynb` is all the code to create the plots of the paper from the optimization results.
Note that for plots for actual variable performance (carbon pools etc.) you will need to download the complete model output from the Zenodo repository (see paper).

## Running the optimization
In the Jupyter notebook `robust_optimization.ipynb` is everything to actually run the optimization from the model outputs.
